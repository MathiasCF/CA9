}{% the abstract
The focus of this project is development and application of optimal model-free machine learning control methods on a small scale water distribution network test setup with one pumping station, one consumer zone and one elevated water reservoir. Methods examined are; tabular Q-Learning and two versions of function approximation Q-Learning - first with one continuous state and later with two continuous states. A cost function is formulated such that pump power is minimised, while water level in the elevated water reservoir is kept within a certain region such that the chance of dry-out or overflow is minimised and consumer demand is met. Convergence properties of methods are compared in a simulated environment in order to find the most suitable control method candidate. This method is tested on a small scale water distribution network test setup in Aalborg Universities Smart Water Infrastructures Laboratory to verify that the method is applicable as a real world control method.
