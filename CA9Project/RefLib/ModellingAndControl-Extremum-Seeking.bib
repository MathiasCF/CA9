abstract = {This paper summarizes our recent work on dynamical properties for a class of extremum seeking (ES) controllers that have attracted a great deal of research attention in the past decade. Their local stability properties were already investigated in [2]. We first show that semi-global practical convergence is possible if the controller parameters are carefully tuned and the objective function has a unique (global) extremum. An interesting tradeoff between the convergence rate and the size of the domain of attraction of the scheme is uncovered: the larger the domain of attraction, the slower the convergence of the algorithm. The amplitude, frequency and shape of the dither signal are important design parameters in the ES controller. In particular, we show that changing the amplitude of the dither adaptively can be used to deal with global ES in presence of local extrema. Moreover, we show that the convergence of the algorithm is proportional to the power of the dither signal. Consequently, the square-wave dither yields the fastest convergence among all dithers of the same frequency and amplitude. We consider ES of a class of bioprocesses to demonstrate our results and motivate some open research questions for multi-valued objective functions. {\textcopyright} 2009 EUCA.},

abstract = {We introduce a new class of extremum seeking controllers able to achieve fixed time convergence to the solution of optimization problems defined by static and dynamical systems. Unlike existing approaches in the literature, the convergence time of the proposed algorithms does not depend on the initial conditions and it can be prescribed a priori by tuning the parameters of the controller. Specifically, our first contribution is a novel gradient-based extremum seeking algorithm for cost functions that satisfy the Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) inequality with some coefficient $\kappa$ > 0, and for which the extremum seeking controller guarantees a fixed upper bound on the convergence time that is independent of the initial conditions but dependent on the coefficient $\kappa$. Second, in order to remove the dependence on $\kappa$, we introduce a novel Newton-based extremum seeking algorithm that guarantees a fully assignable fixed upper bound on the convergence time, thus paralleling existing asymptotic results in Newton-based extremum seeking where the rate of convergence is fully assignable. Finally, we study the problem of optimizing dynamical systems, where the cost function corresponds to the steady state input-to-output map of a stable but unknown dynamical system. In this case, after a time scale transformation is performed, the proposed extremum seeking controllers achieve the same fixed upper bound on the convergence time as in the static case. Our results exploit recent gradient flow structures proposed by Garg and Panagou in [3], and are established by using averaging theory and singular perturbation theory for dynamical systems that are not necessarily Lipschitz continuous. We confirm the validity of our results via numerical simulations that illustrate the key advantages of the extremum seeking controllers presented in this paper.},

abstract = {We consider the distributed optimization problem of networked large-scale systems under specified constraints. In particular, we aim to optimize the steady-state performance of the system by making it (in a distributed manner) working at the optimal operation point. To solve the problem, a primal-dual method is employed to seek the optimal setpoint in conjunction with Extremum Seeking Control (ESC) which is utilized as a tool for efficient gradient estimation without knowing the specific form of the cost functions as well as the constraints of the system. The proposed overall scheme is termed as Distributed Extremum Seeking Control (D-ESC) as it is designed based on the ESC scheme and implemented in a distributed way. It will be shown, by resorting to singular perturbation and averaging theory as well as duality theory, that the overall networked large-scale system equipped with D-ESC is Semi-globally Practically Asymptotically Stable (SPAS) and thus will eventually converge to the neighborhood of the Pareto-optimal solution of the primal problem. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {We propose the inclusion of a dynamic compensator in the extremum seeking algorithm which improves the stability and performance properties of the method. This compensator is added to the integrator used for adaptation to improve the overall relative degree and phase response of the extremum seeking loop. The compensator is potentially more effective in accounting for the plant dynamics than the often used phase shifting of the demodulation signal. We present a detailed analysis of the extremum seeking system based on averaging. This analysis provides two linear models, one for tracking reference changes and the other for sensitivity to noise, which offer insight into how different parameters influence the performance. This analysis is less conservative than in previous cases and allows the use of faster adaptation for improved transients. We extend the extremum seeking method to problems of tracking changes in the set point which are more general than step functions. {\textcopyright} 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {We present a Newton-based extremum seeking algorithm for maximizing higher derivatives of unknown maps in the presence of time-varying delays. Dealing with time-varying delays has impact in the predictor design in terms of the transport PDE with variable convection speed functions, the backstepping transformation as well as the conditions imposed on the delay. First, the delay can grow at a rate strictly smaller than one but not indefinitely, the delay must remain uniformly bounded. Second, the delay may decrease at any uniformly bounded rate but not indefinitely, that is, it must remain positive. We incorporate a filtered predictor feedback with a perturbation-based estimate for the Hessian's inverse using a differential Riccati equation, where the convergence rate of the real-time optimizer can be made user-assignable, rather than being dependent on the unknown Hessian of the higher-derivative map. Furthermore, exponential stability and convergence to a small neighborhood of the unknown extremum point are achieved for locally quadratic derivatives by using backstepping transformation and averaging theory in infinite dimensions.},

Unlike existing asymptotic and fixed-time results in the literature, we present a scheme that achieves (practical) fixed time convergence to a neighborhood of the optimal point, with a convergence time that is independent of the initial conditions and the Hessian of the cost function, and therefore can be arbitrarily assigned a priori by the designer via an appropriate choice of parameters in the algorithm. The extremum seeking dynamics exploit a class of fixed time convergence properties recently established in the literature for a family of Newton flows, as well as averaging results for perturbed dynamical systems that are not necessarily Lipschitz continuous. The proposed extremum seeking algorithm is model-free and does not require any explicit knowledge of the gradient and Hessian of the cost function. Instead, real-time optimization with fixed-time convergence is achieved by using real time measurements of the cost, which is perturbed by a suitable class of periodic excitation signals generated by a dynamic oscillator. Numerical examples illustrate the performance of the algorithm.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the design and analysis of fast Newton-based extremum seeking feedback for scalar static maps in cascade with PDE dynamics in its actuation path. Although more general classes of PDE-based systems could be envisaged, we concentrate our efforts in handling diffusion PDEs. The proposed adaptive control scheme for real-time optimization follows two basic steps: first, it cancels out the effects of the actuation dynamics in the dither signals, and second, it applies a boundary control for the diffusion process via backstepping transformation. In particular, the diffusion compensator employs perturbation-based (averaging-based) estimates for the gradient and Hessian's inverse of the nonlinear-scalar static map to be optimized. The complete stability analysis of the closed-loop system is carried out using Lyapunov's method and applying averaging for infinite-dimensional systems in order to capture the infinite-dimensional state of the actuator model. Local exponential convergence to a small neighborhood of the unknown extremum is guaranteed and verified by means of a numerical example.},

abstract = {We present a Newton-based extremum seeking algorithm for the multivariable case. The design extends the recent Newton-based extremum seeking algorithms for the scalar case and introduces a dynamic estimator of the inverse of the Hessian matrix that removes the difficulty with the possible singularity of a possible direct estimate of the Hessian matrix. The estimator of the inverse of the Hessian has the form of a differential Riccati equation. We prove local stability of the new algorithm for general nonlinear dynamic systems using averaging and singular perturbations. In comparison with the standard gradient-based multivariable extremum seeking, the proposed algorithm removes the dependence of the convergence rate on the unknown Hessian matrix and makes the convergence rate, of both the parameter estimates and of the estimates of the Hessian inverse, user-assignable. In particular, the new algorithm allows all the parameters to converge with the same speed, yielding straight trajectories to the extremum even with maps that have highly elongated level sets, in contrast to curved "steepest descent" trajectories of the gradient algorithm. Simulation results show the advantage of the proposed approach over gradient-based extremum seeking, by assigning equal, desired convergence rates to all the parameters using Newton's approach. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper investigates the application of extremum seeking control (ESC) to maximizing the energy capture of variable speed wind turbines. The optimal control torque and pitch angle are searched via ESC based on the measurement of the rotor power. The advantage of this method is the independency from accurate turbine modelling and wind measurement. Simulation was conducted on FAST for a wind turbine dynamic model, under smooth, turbulent and field recorded wind profiles. The simulation results demonstrated significant improvement in energy capture compared to the standard control with fixed reference. An anti-windup ESC was applied to overcome the integral windup due to actuator saturation which would otherwise disable the ESC process. Finally, the integrator and high-pass filter resetting schemes were applied to improve the transient under the abrupt changes of wind.},

It is shown how extremum seeking can be achieved by combining an arbitrary continuous optimization method (such as gradient descent or continuous Newton) with an estimator for the derivatives of the unknown steady-state reference-to-output map. A tuning strategy is presented for the controller parameters that ensures non-local convergence of all trajectories to the vicinity of the extremum. It is shown that this tuning strategy leads to multiple time scales in the closed-loop dynamics, and that the slowest time scale dynamics approximate the chosen continuous optimization method.
