abstract = {Willems' fundamental lemma and system level synthesis both characterize a linear dynamic system by its input/output sequences. In this work, we show that the extension of the fundamental lemma in uncertain LTI systems is equivalent to the system level synthesis. Inspired by this observation, a robust closed-loop data-enabled predictive control scheme is proposed, where a novel formulation of causal feedback control law is further derived. Two numerical experiments, including the temperature control of a single-zone building, are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed data-driven controller.},

abstract = {Spectral decomposition of the Koopman operator is attracting attention as a tool for the analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems. Dynamic mode decomposition is a popular numerical algorithm for Koopman spectral analysis; however, we often need to prepare nonlinear observables manually according to the underlying dynamics, which is not always possible since we may not have any a priori knowledge about them. In this paper, we propose a fully data-driven method for Koopman spectral analysis based on the principle of learning Koopman invariant subspaces from observed data. To this end, we propose minimization of the residual sum of squares of linear least-squares regression to estimate a set of functions that transforms data into a form in which the linear regression fits well. We introduce an implementation with neural networks and evaluate performance empirically using nonlinear dynamical systems and applications.},

@techreport{Kamb2020,
abstract = {Nonlinear dynamical systems are ubiquitous in science and engineering, yet analysis and prediction of these systems remains a challenge. Koopman operator theory circumvents some of these issues by considering the dynamics in the space of observable functions on the state, in which the dynamics are intrinsically linear and thus amenable to standard techniques from numerical analysis and linear algebra. However, practical issues remain with this approach, as the space of observables is infinite dimensional and selecting a subspace of functions in which to accurately represent the system is a nontrivial task. In this work we consider time-delay observables to represent nonlinear dynamics in the Koopman operator framework. We prove the surprising result that Koopman operators for different systems admit universal (system-independent) representations in these coordinates, and give analytic expressions for these representations. In addition, we show that for certain systems a restricted class of these observables form an optimal finite-dimensional basis for representing the Koopman operator, and that the analytic representation of the Koopman operator in these coordinates coincides with results computed by the dynamic mode decomposition. We provide numerical examples to complement our results. In addition to being theoretically interesting, these results have implications for a number of linearization algorithms for dynamical systems.},

abstract = {We propose spectral methods for long-term forecasting of temporal signals stemming from linear and nonlinear quasi-periodic dynamical systems. For linear signals, we introduce an algorithm with similarities to the Fourier transform but which does not rely on periodicity assumptions, allowing for forecasting given potentially arbitrary sampling intervals. We then extend this algorithm to handle nonlinearities by leveraging Koopman theory. The resulting algorithm performs a spectral decomposition in a nonlinear, data-dependent basis. The optimization objective for both algorithms is highly non-convex. However, expressing the objective in the frequency domain allows us to compute global optima of the error surface in a scalable and efficient manner, partially by exploiting the computational properties of the Fast Fourier Transform. Because of their close relation to Bayesian Spectral Analysis , uncertainty quantification metrics are a natural byproduct of the spectral forecasting methods. We extensively benchmark these algorithms against other leading forecasting methods on a range of synthetic experiments as well as in the context of real-world power systems and fluid flows.},

abstract = {This brief uses an air conditioning system to illustrate the benefits of iteratively combining first principles and system identification techniques to develop control-oriented models of complex systems. A transcritical vapor compression system is initially modeled with first principles and then verified with experimental data. Both single-input-single-output (SISO) and multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) system identification techniques are then used to construct locally linear models. Motivated by the ability to capture the salient dynamic characteristics with low-order identified models, the physical model is evaluated for essentially nonminimal dynamics. A singular perturbation model reduction approach is then applied to obtain a minimal representation of the dynamics more suitable for control design, and yielding insight to the underlying system dynamics previously unavailable in the literature. The results demonstrate that iteratively modeling a complex system with first principles and system identification techniques gives greater confidence in the first principles model, and better understanding of the underlying physical dynamics. Although this iterative process requires more time and effort, significant insight and model improvements can be realized. {\textcopyright} 2005 IEEE.},

@article{Korda2020a,
abstract = {This article presents a novel data-driven framework for constructing eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator geared toward prediction and control. The method leverages the richness of the spectrum of the Koopman operator away from attractors to construct a set of eigenfunctions such that the state (or any other observable quantity of interest) is in the span of these eigenfunctions and hence predictable in a linear fashion. The eigenfunction construction is optimization-based with no dictionary selection required. Once a predictor for the uncontrolled part of the system is obtained in this way, the incorporation of control is done through a multistep prediction error minimization, carried out by a simple linear least-squares regression. The predictor so obtained is in the form of a linear controlled dynamical system and can be readily applied within the Koopman model predictive control (MPC) framework of (M. Korda and I. Mezi{\'{c}}, 2018) to control nonlinear dynamical systems using linear MPC tools. The method is entirely data-driven and based predominantly on convex optimization. The novel eigenfunction construction method is also analyzed theoretically, proving rigorously that the family of eigenfunctions obtained is rich enough to span the space of all continuous functions. In addition, the method is extended to construct generalized eigenfunctions that also give rise Koopman invariant subspaces and hence can be used for linear prediction. Detailed numerical examples demonstrate the approach, both for prediction and feedback control.∗∗Code for the numerical examples is available from https://homepages.laas.fr/mkorda/Eigfuns.zip.},

The control of the electrolyte flow rate during its operation has significant impacts on the overall efficiency of the storage system. Although flow-rate optimization under constant current conditions has been addressed in previous studies, few have dealt with varying (dis-)charge power conditions that are common in practice. In this study, an electrochemical model of the VRB has been developed, considering concentration overpotential and the required pump power consumption. The influence of the electrolyte flow rate on the stack efficiency is investigated, and an optimization framework is proposed for determining the optimal flow rate under varying (dis-)charge power conditions. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework could increase the stack efficiency by 3% and limit the electrolyte temperature increment not exceeding 1.4 K.},

abstract = {In optimization algorithms used for on-line Model Predictive Control (MPC), linear systems of equations are often solved in each iteration. This is true both for Active Set methods as well as for Interior Point methods, and for linear MPC as well as for nonlinear MPC and hybrid MPC. The main computational effort is spent while solving these linear systems of equations, and hence, it is of greatest interest to solve them efficiently. Classically, the optimization problem has been formulated in either of two ways. One leading to a sparse linear system of equations involving relatively many variables to compute in each iteration and another one leading to a dense linear system of equations involving relatively few variables. In this work, it is shown that it is possible not only to consider these two distinct choices of formulations. Instead it is shown that it is possible to create an entire family of formulations with different levels of sparsity and number of variables, and that this extra degree of freedom can be exploited to obtain even better performance with the software and hardware at hand. This result also provides a better answer to a recurring question in MPC; should the sparse or dense formulation be used.},

If a parametric model is known, methods such as Kalman filtering have been developed for this purpose. If no model is known, a hybrid Kalman-Takens method has been recently introduced, in order to exploit the advantages of optimal filtering in a nonparametric setting. This procedure replaces the parametric model with dynamics reconstructed from delay coordinates, while using the Kalman update formulation to assimilate new observations. In this article, we study the efficacy of this method for identifying underlying dynamics in the presence of dynamical noise. Furthermore, by combining the Kalman-Takens method with an adaptive filtering procedure we are able to estimate the statistics of the observational and dynamical noise. This solves a long-standing problem of separating dynamical and observational noise in time series data, which is especially challenging when no dynamical model is specified.},

abstract = {Model predictive control (MPC) has a long history in the field of control en- gineering. It is one of the few areas that has received on-going interest from researchers in both the industrial and academic communities. Four major as- pects of model predictive control make the design methodology attractive to both practitioners and academics. The first aspect is the design formulation, which uses a completely multivariable system framework where the perfor- mance parameters of the multivariable control system are related to the engi- neering aspects of the system; hence, they can be understood and ‘tuned' by engineers. The second aspect is the ability of the method to handle both ‘soft' constraints and hard constraints in a multivariable control framework. This is particularly attractive to industry where tight profit margins and limits on the process operation are inevitably present. The third aspect is the ability to perform on-line process optimization. The fourth aspect is the simplicity of the design framework in handling all these complex issues. This book gives an introduction to model predictive control, and recent developments in design and implementation. Beginning with an overview of the field, the book will systematically cover topics in receding horizon con- trol, MPC design formulations, constrained control, Laguerre-function-based predictive control, predictive control using exponential data weighting, refor- mulation of classical predictive control, tuning of predictive control, as well as simulation and implementation using MATLAB and SIMULINK as a platform.

abstract = {Analyzing data from dynamical systems often begins with creating a reconstruction of the trajectory based on one or more variables, but not all variables are suitable for reconstructing the trajectory. The concept of nonlinear observability has been investigated as a way to determine if a dynamical system can be reconstructed from one signal or a combination of signals [L. A. Aguirre, IEEE Trans. Educ. 38, 33 (1995); C. Letellier, L. A. Aguirre, and J. Maquet, Phys. Rev. E 71, 066213 (2005); L. A. Aguirre, S. B. Bastos, M. A. Alves, and C. Letellier, Chaos 18, 013123 (2008); L. A.

E 91, 062912 (2015)]; however, nonlinear observability can be difficult to calculate for a high dimensional system. In this work, I compare the results from nonlinear observability to a continuity statistic that indicates the likelihood that there is a continuous function between two sets of multidimensional points - in this case, two different reconstructions of the same attractor from different signals are simultaneously measured. Without a metric against which to test the ability to reconstruct a system, the predictions of nonlinear observability and continuity are ambiguous. As an additional test on how well different signals can predict the ability to reconstruct a dynamical system, I use the fitting error from training a reservoir computer.},

abstract = {This work addresses fundamental issues related to the structure and conditioning of linear time-delayed models of non-linear dynamics on an attractor. While this approach has been well-studied in the asymptotic sense (e.g., for an infinite number of delays), the non-asymptotic setting is not well-understood. First, we show that the minimal time-delays required for perfect signal recovery are solely determined by the sparsity in the Fourier spectrum for scalar systems. For the vector case, we provide a rank test and a geometric interpretation for the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an accurate linear time delayed model. Furthermore, we prove that the output controllability index of a linear system induced by the Fourier spectrum serves as a tight upper bound on the minimal number of time delays required. An explicit expression for the exact linear model in the spectral domain is also provided. From a numerical perspective, the effect of the sampling rate and the number of time delays on numerical conditioning is examined. An upper bound on the condition number is derived, with the implication that conditioning can be improved with additional time delays and/or decreasing sampling rates. Moreover, it is explicitly shown that the underlying dynamics can be accurately recovered using only a partial period of the attractor. Our analysis is first validated in simple periodic and quasiperiodic systems, and sensitivity to noise is also investigated. Finally, issues and practical strategies of choosing time delays in large-scale chaotic systems are discussed and demonstrated on 3D turbulent Rayleigh-B{\'{e}}nard convection.},

The aim of the paper is to address the problem of embedding an attractor using more than one observable.

Using the developed framework and a number of worked examples, it is shown that the choice of embedding coordinates is critical. Moreover, in some cases, to reconstruct the dynamics using more than one observable could be worse than to reconstruct using a scalar measurement. Finally, using the developed framework it is shown that increasing the embedding dimension, observability problems diminish and can even be eliminated.

abstract = {This paper develops a new decision making method for optimal planning of railway maintenance operations using hybrid Model Predictive Control (MPC). A linear dynamic model is used to describe the evolution of the health condition of a segment of the railway track. The hybrid characteristics arise from the three possible control actions: performing no maintenance, performing corrective maintenance, or doing a replacement. A detailed procedure for transforming the linear system with switched input, and recasting the transformed problem into a standard mixed integer quadratic programming problem is presented. The merits of the proposed MPC approach for designing railway track maintenance plans are demonstrated using a case study with numerical simulations. The results highlight the potential of MPC to improve condition-based maintenance procedures for railway infrastructure.},

abstract = {In this paper we describe two algorithms to identify a linear, time-invariant, finite dimensional state space model from input-output data. The system to be identified is assumed to be excited by a measurable input and an unknown process noise and the measurements are disturbed by unknown measurement noise. Both noise sequences are discrete zero-mean white noise. The first algorithm gives consistent estimates only for the case where the input also is zero-mean white noise, while the same result is obtained with the second algorithm without this constraint. For the special case where the input signal is discrete zero-mean white noise, it is explicitly shown that this second algorithm is a special case of the recently developed Multivariable Output-Error State Space (moesp) class of algorithms based on instrumental variables. The usefulness of the presented schemes is highlighted in a realistic simulation study. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {We present a general-purpose solver for convex quadratic programs based on the alternating direction method of multipliers, employing a novel operator splitting technique that requires the solution of a quasi-definite linear system with the same coefficient matrix at almost every iteration. Our algorithm is very robust, placing no requirements on the problem data such as positive definiteness of the objective function or linear independence of the constraint functions. It can be configured to be division-free once an initial matrix factorization is carried out, making it suitable for real-time applications in embedded systems. In addition, our technique is the first operator splitting method for quadratic programs able to reliably detect primal and dual infeasible problems from the algorithm iterates. The method also supports factorization caching and warm starting, making it particularly efficient when solving parametrized problems arising in finance, control, and machine learning. Our open-source C implementation OSQP has a small footprint, is library-free, and has been extensively tested on many problem instances from a wide variety of application areas. It is typically ten times faster than competing interior-point methods, and sometimes much more when factorization caching or warm start is used. OSQP has already shown a large impact with tens of thousands of users both in academia and in large corporations.},

abstract = {This paper summarizes our recent work on dynamical properties for a class of extremum seeking (ES) controllers that have attracted a great deal of research attention in the past decade. Their local stability properties were already investigated in [2]. We first show that semi-global practical convergence is possible if the controller parameters are carefully tuned and the objective function has a unique (global) extremum. An interesting tradeoff between the convergence rate and the size of the domain of attraction of the scheme is uncovered: the larger the domain of attraction, the slower the convergence of the algorithm. The amplitude, frequency and shape of the dither signal are important design parameters in the ES controller. In particular, we show that changing the amplitude of the dither adaptively can be used to deal with global ES in presence of local extrema. Moreover, we show that the convergence of the algorithm is proportional to the power of the dither signal. Consequently, the square-wave dither yields the fastest convergence among all dithers of the same frequency and amplitude. We consider ES of a class of bioprocesses to demonstrate our results and motivate some open research questions for multi-valued objective functions. {\textcopyright} 2009 EUCA.},

abstract = {We establish the convergence of a class of numerical algorithms, known as dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), for computation of the eigenv alues and eigenfunctions of the infinite-dimensional Koopman operator. The algorithms act on data coming from observables on a state space, arranged in Hankel-type matrices. The proofs utilize the assumption that the underlying dynamical system is ergodic. This includes the classical measure-preserving systems, as well as systems whose attractors support a physical measure. Our approach relies on the observation that vector projections in DMD can be used to approximate the function projections by the virtue of Birkhoff's ergodic theorem. Using this fact, we show that applying DMD to Hankel data matrices in the limit of infinite-time observations yields the true Koopman eigenfunctions and eigenvalues. We also show that the singular value decomposition, which is the central part of most DMD algorithms, converges to the proper orthogonal decomposition of observables. We use this result to obtain a representation of the dynamics of systems with continuous spectrum based on the lifting of the coordinates to the space of observables. The numerical application of these methods is demonstrated using well-known dynamical systems and examples from computational fluid dynamics.},

Next, recent advances in linear offset-free MPC are described, which show the equivalence of the velocity form algorithm (so far considered an alternative method) to a particular disturbance model and observer. Then, the concepts of offset-free estimation are exploited to design an offset-free economic MPC algorithm, which can asymptotically achieve the highest economic performance despite persistent model errors and disturbances. Extensive application results are presented to show the benefits of offsetfree MPC algorithms over standard ones, and to clarify misconceptions and design errors that can prevent constraint satisfaction, closed-loop stability, and offset-free performance.},

We develop a data-driven regression procedure, bilinear dynamic mode decomposition (biDMD), that leverages time-series measurements to establish quantum system identification for QOC. The biDMD optimization framework is a physics-informed regression that makes use of the known underlying Hamiltonian structure. Further, the biDMD can be modified to model both fast and slow sampling of control signals, the latter by way of stroboscopic sampling strategies. The biDMD method provides a flexible, interpretable, and adaptive regression framework for real-time, online implementation in quantum systems. Further, the method has strong theoretical connections to Koopman theory, which approximates nonlinear dynamics with linear operators. In comparison with many machine learning paradigms minimal data is needed to construct a biDMD model, and the model is easily updated as new data is collected. We demonstrate the efficacy and performance of the approach on a number of representative quantum systems, showing that it also matches experimental results.},

abstract = {A new method, referred to as the sequential quadratic programming method, is presented for determining minimum energy paths. The method is based on minimizing the points representing the path in the subspace perpendicular to the tangent of the path while using a penalty term to prevent kinks from forming. Rather than taking one full step, the minimization is divided into a number of sequential steps on an approximate quadratic surface. The resulting method can efficiently determine the reaction mechanism, from which transition state can be easily identified and refined with other methods. To improve the resolution of the path close to the transition state, points are clustered close to this region with a reparametrization scheme. The usefulness of the algorithm is demonstrated for the Muller-Brown potential, amide hydrolysis, and an 89 atom cluster taken from the active site of 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase for the reaction which catalyzes 2-oxo-4-hexenedioate to the intermediate 2-hydroxy-2,4-hexadienedioate.},

In this paper we demonstrate how nonlinear dynamics with sparse Fourier spectra can be (i) represented by a superposition of principal component trajectories and (ii) modeled by DMD in this coordinate space. For continuous or mixed (discrete and continuous) spectra, DMD can be augmented with an external forcing term. We present a method for learning linear control models in delay coordinates while simultaneously discovering the corresponding exogenous forcing signal in a fully unsupervised manner. This extends the existing DMD with control (DMDc) algorithm to cases where a control signal is not known a priori. We provide examples to validate the learned forcing against a known ground truth and illustrate their statistical similarity. Finally, we offer a demonstration of this method applied to real-world power grid load data to show its utility for diagnostics and interpretation on systems in which somewhat periodic behavior is strongly forced by unknown and unmeasurable environmental variables.},

abstract = {Digitalization and smart control of district heating networks are emerging as key features to make these systems flexible and optimal. However, since effective and scalable methods for large-scale systems are currently unavailable, the implementation of smart controllers can be challenging and time-consuming. This is addressed herein by proposing a novel approach to include the thermal capacity of the connected buildings in the optimal control of large-scale heating networks. A reduced-order model of the aggregated communities supplied by a large-scale network is used to define their State of Charge, which is exploited to store or retrieve energy when convenient, while maintaining indoor comfort. This concept is included in a Model Predictive Controller that optimizes power plant management and heat distribution. The results show that the controller successfully shaves heat supply peaks to different regions up to 16% and reduces the difference between distribution and soil temperature up to 20%. At the same time, the return temperature is kept close to the set-point of 35 °C, which is lower than the historical operation and further reduces distribution heat losses. The procedure can be easily replicated to optimize systems of different sizes and to support their transition to efficient, smart district heating networks.},

abstract = {Data-driven discovery of dynamics via machine learning is pushing the frontiers of modelling and control efforts, providing a tremendous opportunity to extend the reach of model predictive control (MPC). However, many leading methods in machine learning, such as neural networks (NN), require large volumes of training data, may not be interpretable, do not easily include known constraints and symmetries, and may not generalize beyond the attractor where models are trained. These factors limit their use for the online identification of a model in the low-data limit, for example following an abrupt change to the system dynamics. In this work, we extend the recent sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDY) modelling procedure to include the effects of actuation and demonstrate the ability of these models to enhance the performance of MPC, based on limited, noisy data. SINDY models are parsimonious, identifying the fewest terms in the model needed to explain the data, making them interpretable and generalizable. We show that the resulting SINDY-MPC framework has higher performance, requires significantly less data, and is more computationally efficient and robust to noise than NN models, making it viable for online training and execution in response to rapid system changes. SINDY-MPC also shows improved performance over linear data-driven models, although linear models may provide a stopgap until enough data is available for SINDY. SINDY-MPC is demonstrated on a variety of dynamical systems with different challenges.},

Among such systems, vanadium redox flow battery (VRB) is one of the promising approach in application of power grids due to the advantages of safe and reliable operation, flexible design and long cycle life. For the purpose of control and state estimation, it is necessary to establish a suitable mathematical model to describe its dynamic characteristics. The traditional electrical model does not consider the concentration overpotential and pump loss of the battery. This paper develops an electrical equivalent circuit model of vanadium redox flow battery that takes pump loss into account. The proposed model considers the ohmic loss, self-discharge phenomenon, concentration overpotential and pump loss in the battery. Pump loss can reflect the effect of electrolyte flow rate on the performance of vanadium redox batteries. The experiment shows that the pump power loss increases with the increase of electrolyte flow rate. By designing experiments and using genetic algorithms to identify the parameters in the proposed model, the simulation results of the parameter identification results are compared with the experimental data to verify the model.},

Heuristic and intuitive analysis tools guided by this mathematics and realizable on existing computers constitute the core of this review.},

A SISO MFAC controller and a MIMO MFAC controller are designed to control the outlet temperature of evaporator secondary flux and the superheating degree of refrigerant at evaporator outlet by manipulating the expansion valve opening and the compressor speed. The two designed controllers are the pure data driven control methods without using any model information of the refrigeration process in the control implementation by virtue of the dynamic linearization technique, and the PID controllers can be considered as special cases of the two designed controllers. The qualitative and quantitative comparison results between the MFAC schemes and the default PID controllers given in the simulation platform provided by the Benchmark PID 2018 demonstrate the effectiveness of the two designed controllers.},

abstract = {We introduce a new class of extremum seeking controllers able to achieve fixed time convergence to the solution of optimization problems defined by static and dynamical systems. Unlike existing approaches in the literature, the convergence time of the proposed algorithms does not depend on the initial conditions and it can be prescribed a priori by tuning the parameters of the controller. Specifically, our first contribution is a novel gradient-based extremum seeking algorithm for cost functions that satisfy the Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) inequality with some coefficient $\kappa$ > 0, and for which the extremum seeking controller guarantees a fixed upper bound on the convergence time that is independent of the initial conditions but dependent on the coefficient $\kappa$. Second, in order to remove the dependence on $\kappa$, we introduce a novel Newton-based extremum seeking algorithm that guarantees a fully assignable fixed upper bound on the convergence time, thus paralleling existing asymptotic results in Newton-based extremum seeking where the rate of convergence is fully assignable. Finally, we study the problem of optimizing dynamical systems, where the cost function corresponds to the steady state input-to-output map of a stable but unknown dynamical system. In this case, after a time scale transformation is performed, the proposed extremum seeking controllers achieve the same fixed upper bound on the convergence time as in the static case. Our results exploit recent gradient flow structures proposed by Garg and Panagou in [3], and are established by using averaging theory and singular perturbation theory for dynamical systems that are not necessarily Lipschitz continuous. We confirm the validity of our results via numerical simulations that illustrate the key advantages of the extremum seeking controllers presented in this paper.},

To gain an understanding of the general thermal behavior of vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs), we devised and tested a laboratory-scale single VRFB by varying the operating temperature. The voltage efficiency of the VRFB is found to increase from 86.5% to 90.5% at 40mA/cm2 when the operating temperature is increased from 15°C to 55°C. The peak discharge power density is also observed to increase from 259.5mW/cm2 to 349.8mW/cm2 at the same temperature increment. The temperature increase, however, leads to a slight decrease in the coulombic efficiency from 96.2% to 93.7% at the same temperature increments. In addition, the capacity degradation rate is found to be higher at higher temperatures.},

In particular, we aim to optimize the steady-state performance of the system by making it (in a distributed manner) working at the optimal operation point. To solve the problem, a primal-dual method is employed to seek the optimal setpoint in conjunction with Extremum Seeking Control (ESC) which is utilized as a tool for efficient gradient estimation without knowing the specific form of the cost functions as well as the constraints of the system. The proposed overall scheme is termed as Distributed Extremum Seeking Control (D-ESC) as it is designed based on the ESC scheme and implemented in a distributed way. It will be shown, by resorting to singular perturbation and averaging theory as well as duality theory, that the overall networked large-scale system equipped with D-ESC is Semi-globally Practically Asymptotically Stable (SPAS) and thus will eventually converge to the neighborhood of the Pareto-optimal solution of the primal problem. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {A major challenge in the study of dynamical systems is that of model discovery: turning data into models that are not just predictive, but provide insight into the nature of the underlying dynamical system that generated the data. This problem is made more difficult by the fact that many systems of interest exhibit diverse behaviors across multiple time scales. We introduce a number of data-driven strategies for discovering nonlinear multiscale dynamical systems and their embeddings from data. We consider two canonical cases: (i) systems for which we have full measurements of the governing variables and (ii) systems for which we have incomplete measurements. For systems with full state measurements, we show that the recent sparse identification of nonlinear dynamical systems (SINDy) method can discover governing equations with relatively little data, provided that accurate measurements of the derivatives can be computed from the data. We introduce a sampling method that allows SINDy to scale efficiently to problems with multiple time scales; specifically, we can discover distinct governing equations at slow and fast scales. For systems with incomplete observations, we show that the Hankel alternative view of Koopman (HAVOK) method, based on time-delay embedding coordinates, can be used to obtain a linear model and Koopman invariant measurement system that nearly perfectly captures the dynamics of nonlinear quasiperiodic systems on the attractor. We introduce two strategies for using HAVOK on systems with multiple time scales. Together, our approaches provide a suite of mathematical strategies for reducing the data required to discover and model nonlinear multiscale systems.},

For systems in which such underlying low-dimensional dynamics is time-varying, a time-invariant approximation of such dynamics computed through standard DMD techniques may not be appropriate. We focus on DMD techniques for such time-varying systems and develop incremental algorithms for systems without and with exogenous control inputs. We build upon the work in [35] to scenarios in which high dimensional data are governed by low dimensional time-varying dynamics. We consider two classes of algorithms that rely on (i) a discount factor on previous observations, and (ii) a sliding window of observations. Our algorithms leverage existing techniques for incremental singular value decomposition and allow us to determine an appropriately reduced model at each time and are applicable even if data matrix is singular. We apply the developed algorithms for autonomous systems to Electroencephalographic (EEG) data and demonstrate their effectiveness in terms of reconstruction and prediction. Our algorithms for non-autonomous systems are illustrated using randomly generated linear time-varying systems.},

abstract = {Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) [27] is an algorithm that approximates the action of the Koopman operator on an N-dimensional subspace of the space of observables by sampling at M points in the state space. Assuming that the samples are drawn either independently or ergodically from some measure µ, it was shown in [11] that, in the limit as M → ∞, the EDMD operator K N,M converges to K N , where K N is the L 2 (µ)-orthogonal projection of the action of the Koopman operator on the finite-dimensional subspace of observables. We show that, as N → ∞, the operator K N converges in the strong operator topology to the Koopman operator. This in particular implies convergence of the predictions of future values of a given observable over any finite time horizon, a fact important for practical applications such as forecasting, estimation and control. In addition, we show that accumulation points of the spectra of K N correspond to the eigenvalues of the Koopman operator with the associated eigenfunctions converging weakly to an eigenfunction of the Koopman operator , provided that the weak limit of the eigenfunctions is nonzero. As a by-product, we propose an analytic version of the EDMD algorithm which, under some assumptions , allows one to construct K N directly, without the use of sampling. Finally, under additional assumptions, we analyze convergence of K N,N (i.e., M = N), proving convergence , along a subsequence, to weak eigenfunctions (or eigendistributions) related to the eigenmeasures of the Perron-Frobenius operator. No assumptions on the observ-ables belonging to a finite-dimensional invariant subspace of the Koopman operator are required throughout.},

We derived a new criterion based on low dimensional approximation of joint mutual information for time delay selection, which can be solved efficiently through the use of an intelligent optimization algorithm with low computation complexity. The embedding dimension is determined by conditional entropy, after which the reconstructed variables have relatively strong independence and low redundancy. The scheme, which integrates nonuniform embedding and feature selection, results in better reconstructions for multivariate chaotic systems. Moreover, the proposed nonuniform state space reconstruction method shows good performance in forecasting benchmark and actual multivariate chaotic time series.},

abstract = {Bounded input delay frequently arises in discrete-time linear systems. The standard predictor feedback design requires the exact knowledge of the delay. Such a requirement on the availability of the delay knowledge poses challenges in the design of robust control laws when only the knowledge of an upper bound of the delay is known. We propose such a design in this article. Based on the delay-independent truncated predictor state feedback design, an observer-based output feedback law is constructed that does not contain any explicit information of the delay. For a general, possibly exponentially unstable, discrete-time linear system, the proposed output feedback law stabilizes the system as long as the delay does not exceed a certain amount. For the special case of systems with all the open-loop poles on or inside the unit circle, a low gain feedback design is presented. This low gain design allows us to establish that, when all the open-loop poles of a system are at z = 1 or inside the unit circle, stabilization can be achieved for an arbitrarily large bounded delay as long as the value of the low gain parameter is chosen small enough.},

The first is the relationship of the spectral properties of the dynamics on the attractor of the original, high-dimensional dynamical system with the properties and possibilities for model reduction. We review some elements of the spectral theory of dynamical systems. We apply this theory to obtain a decomposition of the process that utilizes spectral properties of the linear Koopman operator associated with the asymptotic dynamics on the attractor. This allows us to extract the almost periodic part of the evolving process. The remainder of the process has continuous spectrum. The second topic we discuss is that of model validation, where the original, possibly high-dimensional dynamics and the dynamics of the reduced model - that can be deterministic or stochastic - are compared in some norm. Using the "statistical Takens theorem" proven in (Mezi{\'{c}}, I. and Banaszuk, A.

The result is a decomposition of chaotic dynamics into a linear model in the leading delay coordinates with forcing by low energy delay coordinates; we call this the Hankel alternative view of Koopman (HAVOK) analysis. This analysis is applied to the canonical Lorenz system, as well as to real-world examples such as the Earth's magnetic field reversal, and data from electrocardiogram, electroencephalogram, and measles outbreaks. In each case, the forcing statistics are non-Gaussian, with long tails corresponding to rare events that trigger intermittent switching and bursting phenomena; this forcing is highly predictive, providing a clear signature that precedes these events.

To this end, we implement a traditional data assimilation system based on the Square Root Analysis (SQRA) filtering scheme and the newly developed data-driven Kalman-Takens technique to update the water components of a hydrological model with the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) terrestrial water storage (TWS), and soil moisture products from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) and Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) in a 5-day temporal scale. While SQRA relies on a physical model for forecasting, the Kalman-Takens only requires a trajectory of the system based on past data. We are particularly interested in testing both methods for assimilating different combination of the satellite data. In most of the cases, simultaneous assimilation of the satellite data by either standard SQRA or Kalman-Takens achieves the largest improvements in the hydrological state, in terms of the agreement with independent in-situ measurements. Furthermore, the Kalman-Takens approach performs comparably well to dynamical method at a fraction of the computational cost.},

abstract = {Transporting a suspended payload with a multirotor has many applications. Knowledge of the payload dynamics is required to adjust the control of the system to damp payload oscillations. Often, the dynamics of the payload are unknown and cannot be represented with an a priori model before a flight. This paper proposes a Model Predictive Control (MPC) architecture that controls a multirotor carrying an unknown suspended payload using a plant model from data-driven system identification techniques. Dynamic Mode Decomposition with Control (DMDc) and Hankel Alternative View Of Koopman with Control (HAVOKc) are the regression techniques used to identify system models without relying on modelling assumptions and by using only time series measurements. The standard Hankel Alternative View Of Koopman (HAVOK) is adapted slightly in this work for use with controlled systems. These two techniques are combined in the MPC architecture and compared against a conventional Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) system to control a multirotor with an unknown suspended payload within simulation. The results show that both MPC systems outperform the conventional system and achieve velocity control while simultaneously damping the payload swing angle. The proposed systems also show good adaptability with different payload parameters. Both system identification methods perform well with the presence of measurement noise.},

abstract = {We demonstrate that the integration of the recently developed dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) with a multi-resolution analysis allows for a decomposition method capable of robustly separating complex systems into a hierarchy of multi-resolution time-scale components. A one-level separation allows for background (low-rank) and foreground (sparse) separation of dynamical data, or robust principal component analysis. The multi-resolution dynamic mode decomposition is capable of characterizing nonlinear dynamical systems in an equation-free manner by recursively decomposing the state of the system into low-rank terms whose temporal coefficients in time are known. DMD modes with temporal frequencies near the origin (zero-modes) are interpreted as background (low-rank) portions of the given dynamics, and the terms with temporal frequencies bounded away from the origin are their sparse counterparts. The multi-resolution dynamic mode decomposition (mrDMD) method is demonstrated on several examples involving multi-scale dynamical data, showing excellent decomposition results, including sifting the El Ni\$\sim$no mode from ocean temperature data. It is further applied to decompose a video data set into separate objects moving at different rates against a slowly varying background. These examples show that the decomposition is an effective dynamical systems tool for data-driven discovery.},

The compensator is potentially more effective in accounting for the plant dynamics than the often used phase shifting of the demodulation signal. We present a detailed analysis of the extremum seeking system based on averaging. This analysis provides two linear models, one for tracking reference changes and the other for sensitivity to noise, which offer insight into how different parameters influence the performance. This analysis is less conservative than in previous cases and allows the use of faster adaptation for improved transients.

The internal parameters of vanadium redox flow battery will change in real time during operation. In order to ensure the reliable operation of the battery, an accurate electrical model needs to be established to monitor and predict the battery status in real time. In this paper, an RC equivalent model is established for vanadium redox flow battery, and the parameters are identified based on the model. In order to overcome the shortcomings of recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm, which is prone to data saturation and not tracking the time-varying parameters, this paper proposes a model parameter identification method based on the multiple innovation recursive least squares (MIRLS) algorithm. Based on the data collected in the pulse charging experiment, RLS and MIRLS algorithms were used to identify the model parameters. The experiments were performed on Wuhan University of Technology's 5kW / 3kWh VRB experimental platform, and the results show that the MIRLS algorithm has better convergence and accuracy in tracking time-varying parameters.},

abstract = {In recent years the theory of Hilbert space and its linear transformations has come into prominence.' It has been recognized to an increasing extent that many of the most important departments of mathematical physics can be subsumed under this theory. In classical physics, for example in those phenomena which are governed by linear conditions-linear differential or integral equations and the like, in those relating to harmonic analysis, and in many phenomena due to the operation of the laws of chance, the essential r6le is played by certain linear transformations in Hilbert space. And the importance of the theory in quantum mechanics is known to all. It is the object of this note to outline certain investigations of our own in which the domain of this theory has been extended in such a way as to include classical Hamiltonian mechanics, or, more generally, systems defining a steady n-dimensional flow of a fluid of positive density. Consider the dynamical system of n degrees of freedom, the canonical equations of which are formed from the Hamiltonian H(q, p) = H(ql, * a qny ply .... ps), which we will assume to be single-valued, real, and analytic in a certain 2n-dimensional region R of the real qp-space. The solutions, or equations of motion, are qk = fk(q0, p0, t), Pk = gk(q0, po, t), (k = 1, ..., n), these functions being single-valued, real and analytic for all (q°, p°) in R and for t in a real interval containing t = 0 dependent on (q°, p°). It is shown that the transformation St: (q°, po) > (q, p) defined by these equations for suitably restricted t has the formal properties: St1S1, = Si, + ,, So = I. The system admits the "integral of energy" H(q, p) = const.; hence, if Ql denote a variety H(q, p) = C of points of R, a path curve of St having one point on Q will remain on Q as long as the curve remains in R. We shall assume that C is such that this is the case for all values of t; this will be the situation, for example, if Q consists of a closed set of interior points of R. It is shown that under these conditions fk and gk are analytic for all (q°, p°) on Q and for-co < t < + o, so that SI effectuates a one-parameter group of analytic automorphisms of U. Furthermore, St leaves invariant the value of a certain integral fpdw taken over an arbitrary region of U; here, p is a positive, single-valued, analytic function on Q. This is a consequence of the fact that .dqi.. dqn, dp... dp, is an integral invariant of the system. In the special case where there are m further integrals Fj(q, p) = Cj of the system,},

Dealing with time-varying delays has impact in the predictor design in terms of the transport PDE with variable convection speed functions, the backstepping transformation as well as the conditions imposed on the delay. First, the delay can grow at a rate strictly smaller than one but not indefinitely, the delay must remain uniformly bounded. Second, the delay may decrease at any uniformly bounded rate but not indefinitely, that is, it must remain positive. We incorporate a filtered predictor feedback with a perturbation-based estimate for the Hessian's inverse using a differential Riccati equation, where the convergence rate of the real-time optimizer can be made user-assignable, rather than being dependent on the unknown Hessian of the higher-derivative map. Furthermore, exponential stability and convergence to a small neighborhood of the unknown extremum point are achieved for locally quadratic derivatives by using backstepping transformation and averaging theory in infinite dimensions.},

The influence of these phenomena on the capacity decay was systematically analyzed, revealing considerable impact of convection component, which dominates under diffusion and migration and mainly responsible for observed capacity loss. The model allows to simulate main characteristics of VRFB systems (such as battery voltage, state of charge, charge/discharge time and capacity decay due to crossover) with high accuracy. The model was validated with experimental data in the wide range of current densities (40–100 mA cm−2), and the results demonstrated good agreement with experiments having an average error within 5% range. In addition, the model requires a modest computational time and power, and, therefore, it can be suitable for application in advanced control-monitoring tools, which are necessary for a long-service life and sustainable operation of VRFB systems.},

abstract = {Time-delay embedding and dimensionality reduction are powerful techniques for discovering effective coordinate systems to represent the dynamics of physical systems. Recently, it has been shown that models identified by dynamic mode decomposition on time-delay coordinates provide linear representations of strongly nonlinear systems, in the so-called Hankel alternative view of Koopman (HAVOK) approach. Curiously, the resulting linear model has a matrix representation that is approximately antisymmetric and tridiagonal; for chaotic systems, there is an additional forcing term in the last component. In this paper, we establish a new theoretical connection between HAVOK and the Frenet-Serret frame from differential geometry, and also develop an improved algorithm to identify more stable and accurate models from less data. In particular, we show that the sub- and super-diagonal entries of the linear model correspond to the intrinsic curvatures in the Frenet-Serret frame. Based on this connection, we modify the algorithm to promote this antisymmetric structure, even in the noisy, low-data limit. We demonstrate this improved modelling procedure on data from several nonlinear synthetic and real-world examples.},

Thus, the equivalent circuit of VRFB should consider the self-discharge to enhance the accuracy of the state of charge (SOC) estimation. This paper proposes the equivalent circuit model of VRFB, which is comprised of the basic RC ladder. In addition, to consider the self-discharge of VRFB the proposed equivalent circuit takes into account that the capacitance of the vanadium redox flow battery is changed by the charging and discharging cycles. The self-discharge test profile was proposed by applying the decreased capacity depending on cycles, and the derived amount of self-discharge was applied to the RC ladder based equivalent circuit model based on resistance. The parameters for the equivalent circuit model is extracted by the actual experimental data. The equivalent circuit model with the basic RC ladder is modeled by using MATLAB/Simulink. Based on the equivalent circuit model considering self-discharge, EKF (Extended Kalman filter) suitable for nonlinear system of vanadium redox flow battery was used for SOC estimation.},

This interface information has never been included in previous lumped-parameter models developed for control design purpose, although it is essential in predicting the refrigerant superheat or subcool value. This model relates critical performance outputs, such as evaporating pressure, condensing pressure, and superheat, to actuating inputs including compressor speed, fan speed, and expansion valve opening. In view of regulating multiple performance outputs in modern heat pumps and air conditioning systems, this model is highly useful for design of multivariable feedback control.},

abstract = {This paper presents a class of linear predictors for nonlinear controlled dynamical systems. The basic idea is to lift the nonlinear dynamics into a higher dimensional space where its evolution is approximately linear. In an uncontrolled setting, this procedure amounts to a numerical approximation of the Koopman operator associated to the nonlinear dynamics. In this work, we extend the Koopman operator to controlled dynamical systems and compute a finite-dimensional approximation of the operator in such a way that this approximation has the form a linear controlled dynamical system. In numerical examples, the linear predictors obtained in this way exhibit a performance superior to existing linear predictors such as those based on local linearization or the so-called Carleman linearization. Importantly, the procedure to construct these linear predictors is completely data-driven and extremely simple -- it boils down to a nonlinear transformation of the data (the lifting) and a linear least squares problem in the lifted space that can be readily solved for large data sets. These linear predictors can be readily used to design controllers for the nonlinear dynamical system using linear controller design methodologies. We focus in particular on model predictive control (MPC) and show that MPC controllers designed in this way enjoy computational complexity of the underlying optimization problem comparable to that of MPC for a linear dynamical system of the same size. Importantly, linear inequality constraints on the state and control inputs as well as nonlinear constraints on the state can be imposed in a linear fashion in the proposed MPC scheme. Similarly, cost functions nonlinear in the state variable can be handled in a linear fashion. Numerical examples (including a high-dimensional nonlinear PDE control) demonstrate the approach with the source code available online.},

abstract = {Thermal issue is one of the major concerns for safe, reliable, and efficient operation of the vanadium redox flow battery (VRB) energy storage systems. During the design of the operational strategy for a grid-connected VRB system, a suitable mathematical model is needed to predict the dynamic behaviors under various operating conditions. However, conventional VRB models usually neglect the impact of temperature variations on system performance. This work develops an enhanced VRB model with the consideration of the coupling effects between the electrochemical and the thermal behaviors. The proposed model consists of two equivalent circuits. First, the electrochemical behaviors of the VRB are modeled by a second-order RC network taking account of the effects of concentration variation of the vanadium ions and the electrochemical activation. Second, a third-order Cauer network is used to model the heat transfer process in the VRB system, and the dynamic thermal behaviors of stacks, pipes and heat exchangers are characterized. Well-designed experiments and particle swarm optimization algorithm are use to identify the parametric values of the developed model. The proposed modeling method was validated experimentally using a 5kW/3kWh VRB platform, and the results show that the model is capable of accurately predicting the VRB performance under variable temperature conditions. The developed coupled electro-thermal model is then used for simulating and analyzing the performance of a VRB system operated in conjunction with a wind power plant under real-world conditions.},

abstract = {For any nonautonomous dynamical system, the family of Koopman operators, as well as related Koopman eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, is parameterized by a time pair. Therefore, a logical approach in the data-driven algorithms for the nonautonomous Koopman mode decomposition is the application of a dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) method on the moving stencils of snapshots in order to capture the time dependency. In this paper, we investigate the issues that arise in such an approach. These issues do not appear if we use the moving stencil approach as the model fitting method; they appear as significant errors in the computed nonautonomous Koopman operator eigenvalues. The first issue manifests itself in the hybrid dynamical systems when the moving stencil passes over a nonautonomous switching point. We show that such stencils can be detected through the Krylov subspace projection error and propose an algorithm that computes correct eigenvalues by avoiding such stencils. The second issue appears in the continuous-in-time nonautonomous systems. Even if we apply techniques of finding good observables that solve all issues in the autonomous case, the nonautonomous Koopman eigenvalues will still be computed with a significant error. In the presented theorems, we reveal the nature of this error and propose a second algorithm that is based on the reduction of the stencil size. The application of the two new data-driven algorithms on various nonautonomous systems shows complete recovery from the errors otherwise present in computation of the nonautonomous Koopman operator eigenvalues.},

Unlike existing asymptotic and fixed-time results in the literature, we present a scheme that achieves (practical) fixed time convergence to a neighborhood of the optimal point, with a convergence time that is independent of the initial conditions and the Hessian of the cost function, and therefore can be arbitrarily assigned a priori by the designer via an appropriate choice of parameters in the algorithm. The extremum seeking dynamics exploit a class of fixed time convergence properties recently established in the literature for a family of Newton flows, as well as averaging results for perturbed dynamical systems that are not necessarily Lipschitz continuous. The proposed extremum seeking algorithm is model-free and does not require any explicit knowledge of the gradient and Hessian of the cost function. Instead, real-time optimization with fixed-time convergence is achieved by using real time measurements of the cost, which is perturbed by a suitable class of periodic excitation signals generated by a dynamic oscillator. Numerical examples illustrate the performance of the algorithm.},

Although more general classes of PDE-based systems could be envisaged, we concentrate our efforts in handling diffusion PDEs. The proposed adaptive control scheme for real-time optimization follows two basic steps: first, it cancels out the effects of the actuation dynamics in the dither signals, and second, it applies a boundary control for the diffusion process via backstepping transformation. In particular, the diffusion compensator employs perturbation-based (averaging-based) estimates for the gradient and Hessian's inverse of the nonlinear-scalar static map to be optimized. The complete stability analysis of the closed-loop system is carried out using Lyapunov's method and applying averaging for infinite-dimensional systems in order to capture the infinite-dimensional state of the actuator model. Local exponential convergence to a small neighborhood of the unknown extremum is guaranteed and verified by means of a numerical example.},

However, existing DMD theory deals primarily with sequential time series for which the measurement dimension is much larger than the number of measurements taken. We present a theoretical framework in which we define DMD as the eigendecomposition of an approximating linear operator. This generalizes DMD to a larger class of datasets, including nonsequential time series. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by presenting novel sampling strategies that increase computational effciency and mitigate the effects of noise, respectively. We also introduce the concept of linear consistency, which helps explain the potential pitfalls of applying DMD to rank-deficient datasets, illustrating with examples. Such computations are not considered in the existing literature but can be understood using our more general framework. In addition, we show that our theory strengthens the connections between DMD and Koopman operator theory. It also establishes connections between DMD and other techniques, including the eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA), a system identification method, and linear inverse modeling (LIM), a method from climate science. We show that under certain conditions, DMD is equivalent to LIM.},

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to develop a model for simulating the thermal and hydraulic behavior of space heating systems with radiators controlled by thermostat valves (TRVs) in multi-family buildings. This is done by treating the building and the heating system as a complete entity. Sub-models for rooms, radiators, TRVs, and the hydraulic network are derived. Then the suggested sub-models are combined to form an integrated model by considering interactions between them. The proposed model takes into account the heat transfer between neighboring rooms, the transport delay in the radiator, the self-adjusting function of the TRV, and the consumer's regulation behavior, as well as the hydraulic interactions between consumers. To test the model, two space heating systems in Beijing and Tianjin were investigated, and the model was validated under three operation modes. There was good agreement between the measured and simulated values for room temperature, return water temperature, and flow rate. A modeling analysis case was given based on an existing building and heating system. It was found that when the set value of the TRVs were kept on 2-3, about 12.4% reduction of heat consumption could be gained, compared with the situation in which the TRVs were kept fully open. The water flow rate was an important index that truly reflected the heat load change. It was also noted that if the flow rate or supply water temperature changed much during the transport delay time in the radiator, ignoring the transport delay would introduce an obvious deviation of the simulation results. Additionally, when an apartment stopped using the heating system during a heating season, the heat consumption of its neighboring apartments would be increased about 6-14%. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Batteries are the crucial link in accelerating the penetration of renewables in distributed grid systems. With multiple sources (most of which are intermittent), there is a need to optimize the usage of these energy storage systems. It is vital to have a charging algorithm to intelligently charge the battery, considering the losses and state of health. Several battery charging techniques exist for most of the mainstream batteries such as lithium ion and lead acid batteries. These charging algorithms are developed for specific battery chemistries to optimize the charging operation by controlling the charging current. There has been no specific charging methodology proposed, considering the uniqueness of flow batteries. In this paper a flow battery model is developed to accommodate the implementation of charging protocols by controlling the current and flow rate in real time. The aim is to demonstrate a methodology where different user requirements can be programmed for efficient operation of the battery to perform a given task. The control is established by an intuitive fuzzy logic controller for changing the input variables based on the intrinsic losses, pump power loss and the capacity decay due to the aging of the battery. The need for such a controller to handle different scenarios of operation arises from the vast applicability of large scale energy storage. A simple example of such a system is proposed with demonstrating three operator selectable modes namely Autonomous (A), Energy bias (E) and Time bias (T). In each case, a specific current value and flow rate value is selected by the controller and is fine-tuned during the charging process. The values are tuned for specific modes of operation and different aspects of the battery performance are studied for these modes. This work demonstrates a method to leverage the use of a physical model based system in a high level user interface for controlling flow batteries.},

The design extends the recent Newton-based extremum seeking algorithms for the scalar case and introduces a dynamic estimator of the inverse of the Hessian matrix that removes the difficulty with the possible singularity of a possible direct estimate of the Hessian matrix. The estimator of the inverse of the Hessian has the form of a differential Riccati equation. We prove local stability of the new algorithm for general nonlinear dynamic systems using averaging and singular perturbations. In comparison with the standard gradient-based multivariable extremum seeking, the proposed algorithm removes the dependence of the convergence rate on the unknown Hessian matrix and makes the convergence rate, of both the parameter estimates and of the estimates of the Hessian inverse, user-assignable. In particular, the new algorithm allows all the parameters to converge with the same speed, yielding straight trajectories to the extremum even with maps that have highly elongated level sets, in contrast to curved "steepest descent" trajectories of the gradient algorithm. Simulation results show the advantage of the proposed approach over gradient-based extremum seeking, by assigning equal, desired convergence rates to all the parameters using Newton's approach. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Further, the computational cost associated with the DMD analysis of a large dataset is high, both in terms of central processing unit and memory.

Given a time series, DDA uses a delay differential equation for approximating the measured data. The lower the least squares error between the predicted and recorded data, the higher the observability. We thus rank the variables of several chaotic systems according to their corresponding least square error to assess observability. The performance of our approach is evaluated by comparison with the ranking provided by the symbolic observability coefficients as well as with two other data-based approaches using reservoir computing and singular value decomposition of the reconstructed space. We investigate the robustness of our approach against noise contamination.},

abstract = {Hydronic cooling systems are often used in large buildings. In these systems, chilled water is transported from the chillers to Air Handling Units (AHUs) via a water distribution system. The temperature of exhaust air is controlled by the flow of the chilled water in AHUs. Due to a poorly balanced hydronic network, some of the AHUs may experience starvation at high load conditions, meaning that air temperature control is impossible. To overcome this problem, we propose an automatic approach to balancing the hydronic system, such that all AHUs can control their air temperatures. The cost is that all zones of the building are controlled to a slightly higher air temperature, which often can be compensated by higher air flow, to keep the room temperature at the desired value. The balancing algorithm is verified on a Modelica model of an office building.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel episodic method to learn a robot's nonlinear dynamics model and an increasingly optimal control sequence for a set of tasks. The method is based on the Koopman operator approach to nonlinear dynamical systems analysis, which models the flow of observables in a function space, rather than a flow in a state space. Practically, this method estimates a nonlinear diffeomorphism that lifts the dynamics to a higher dimensional space where they are linear. Efficient Model Predictive Control methods can then be applied to the lifted model. This approach allows for real time implementation in on-board hardware, with rigorous incorporation of both input and state constraints during learning. We demonstrate the method in a real-time implementation of fast multirotor landing, where the nonlinear ground effect is learned and used to improve landing speed and quality.},

abstract = {Structure and function go hand in hand. However, while a complex structure can be relatively safely broken down into the minutest parts, and technology is now delving into nanoscales, the function of complex systems requires a completely different approach. Here the complexity clearly arises from nonlinear interactions, which prevents us from obtaining a realistic description of a system by dissecting it into its structural component parts. At best, the result of such investigations does not substantially add to our understanding or at worst it can even be misleading. Not surprisingly, the dynamics of complex systems, facilitated by increasing computational efficiency, is now readily tackled in the case of measured time series. Moreover, time series can now be collected in practically every branch of science and in any structural scale-from protein dynamics in a living cell to data collected in astrophysics or even via social networks. In searching for deterministic patterns in such data we are limited by the fact that no complex system in the real world is autonomous. Hence, as an alternative to the stochastic approach that is predominantly applied to data from inherently non-autonomous complex systems, theory and methods specifically tailored to non-autonomous systems are needed. Indeed, in the last decade we have faced a huge advance in mathematical methods, including the introduction of pullback attractors, as well as time series methods that cope with the most important characteristic of non-autonomous systems-their time-dependent behaviour. Here we review current methods for the analysis of non-autonomous dynamics including those for extracting properties of interactions and the direction of couplings. We illustrate each method by applying it to three sets of systems typical for chaotic, stochastic and non-autonomous behaviour. For the chaotic class we select the Lorenz system, for the stochastic the noise-forced Duffing system and for the non-autonomous the Poincar{\'{e}} oscillator with quasi-periodic forcing. In this way we not only discuss and review each method, but also present properties which help to clearly distinguish the three classes of systems when analysed in an inverse approach-from measured, or numerically generated data. In particular, this review provides a framework to tackle inverse problems in these areas and clearly distinguish non-autonomous dynamics from chaos or stochasticity.},

This circumvents the computational issues that arise due to the number of basis functions required to span a "sufficiently rich" subspace of the space of scalar observables in such applications.

The frictional disturbances of mechanical elements in relative motion often limit their positioning performances. If nanometric positioning precision and accuracy are aimed for, frictional disturbances have thus to be identified, modeled and compensated for via appropriate control algorithms. Suitable experimental setups are therefore employed to study the effects of frictional disturbances. The parameters related to state-of-the-art friction models are experimentally identified. Different control algorithms, such as a PID controller, a feedforward controller, and adaptive controllers, are experimentally and numerically validated and compared. It is proven that adaptive controllers enable nanometric precision positioning, but in point-to-point positioning applications can give rise to large overshoots and issues related to lengthy settling times. It is shown that these problems can be minimized by employing the Koopman-based model predictive control that allows simplifying the modeling burden while successfully compensating the frictional effects.},

DMD finds spatial-temporal coherent modes, connects local-linear analysis to nonlinear operator theory, and provides an equation-free architecture which is compatible with compressive sensing. In actuated systems, DMD is incapable of producing an input-output model; moreover, the dynamics and the modes will be corrupted by external forcing. Our new method, dynamic mode decomposition with control (DMDc), capitalizes on all of the advantages of DMD and provides the additional innovation of being able to disambiguate between the underlying dynamics and the effects of actuation, resulting in accurate input-output models. The method is data-driven in that it does not require knowledge of the underlying governing equations-only snapshots in time of observables and actuation data from historical, experimental, or black-box simulations. We demonstrate the method on high-dimensional dynamical systems, including a model with relevance to the analysis of infectious disease data with mass vaccination (actuation).},

The advantage of this method is the independency from accurate turbine modelling and wind measurement. Simulation was conducted on FAST for a wind turbine dynamic model, under smooth, turbulent and field recorded wind profiles. The simulation results demonstrated significant improvement in energy capture compared to the standard control with fixed reference. An anti-windup ESC was applied to overcome the integral windup due to actuator saturation which would otherwise disable the ESC process. Finally, the integrator and high-pass filter resetting schemes were applied to improve the transient under the abrupt changes of wind.},

abstract = {In this work, we explore finite-dimensional linear representations of nonlinear dynamical systems by restricting the Koopman operator to an invariant subspace spanned by specially chosen observable functions. The Koopman operator is an infinite-dimensional linear operator that evolves functions of the state of a dynamical system. Dominant terms in the Koopman expansion are typically computed using dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). DMD uses linear measurements of the state variables, and it has recently been shown that this may be too restrictive for nonlinear systems. Choosing the right nonlinear observable functions to form an invariant subspace where it is possible to obtain linear reduced-order models, especially those that are useful for control, is an open challenge. Here, we investigate the choice of observable functions for Koopman analysis that enable the use of optimal linear control techniques on nonlinear problems. First, to include a cost on the state of the system, as in linear quadratic regulator (LQR) control, it is helpful to include these states in the observable subspace, as in DMD. However, we find that this is only possible when there is a single isolated fixed point, as systems with multiple fixed points or more complicated attractors are not globally topologically conjugate to a finite-dimensional linear system, and cannot be represented by a finite-dimensional linear Koopman subspace that includes the state. We then present a data-driven strategy to identify relevant observable functions for Koopman analysis by leveraging a new algorithm to determine relevant terms in a dynamical system by l1-regularized regression of the data in a nonlinear function space; we also show how this algorithm is related to DMD. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of nonlinear observable subspaces in the design of Koopman operator optimal control laws for fully nonlinear systems using techniques from linear optimal control.},

Moreover a number of vapor compression systems are already equipped with variable speed-compressors and fans. However, due to lack of knowledge about the dynamic behavior of these systems, the industry has not taken full advantage of these variable devices to get substantial control performance improvement.

abstract = {In the analysis of a scalar time series, which lies on an m-dimensional object, a great number of techniques will start by embedding such a time series in a d-dimensional space, with d>m. Therefore there is a coordinate transformation {\^{I}}s from the original phase space to the embedded one. The embedding space depends on the observable s(t). In theory, the main results reached are valid regardless of s(t). In a number of practical situations, however, the choice of the observable does influence our ability to extract dynamical information from the embedded attractor. This may arise in problems in nonlinear dynamics such as model building, control and synchronization. To some degree, ease of success will depend on the choice of the observable simply because it is related to the observability of the dynamics. In this paper the observability matrix for nonlinear systems, which uses Lie derivatives, is revisited. It is shown that such a matrix can be interpreted as the Jacobian matrix of {\^{I}}s-the map between the original phase space and the differential embedding induced by the observable-thus establishing a link between observability and embedding theory. {\textcopyright} 2005 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Many parameter estimation algorithms used in system identification are based on numerical schemes to solve parametric optimization problems. Apart from the fact that the user has to make a selection on a particular model parameterization, the iterative nature of many of these optimization schemes requires accurate initial estimates. On the one hand, both selections can have a critical influence on the results of the optimization run and on the quality of the identified model. On the other hand, providing the user with reliable information on both selection items has long remained an open and challenging research topic. Subspace identification methods have the potential to provide extremely useful information in the two critical selections mentioned above. A vast amount of practical evidence has shown that the results obtained by the non-iterative subspace identification schemes do not need further improvement in iterative parametric optimization methods. This chapter highlights the fundamental nature of subspace identification algorithms. A crucial step in the analysis and solution of subspace identification methods is to relate input and output data to the system matrices in a structured manner so both data and model information are represented as matrices and not just as vectors and matrices as is the case in the classical definition of state space models.},

abstract = {As the demands for accuracy and throughput in industrial positioning systems are increasing, classical control of ironless linear motors (ILMs) is facing its limit. Classical control scheme of an ILM typically consists of a simple sinusoidal commutation algorithm and a PID feedback controller. Classical commutation cannot compensate for parasitic effects, while classical PID feedback controller cannot guarantee constraints satisfaction. This problem can be addressed by replacing classical commutation with optimal commutation and PID controller with linear model predictive controller (LMPC). However, this LMPC and optimal commutation scheme requires solving two separate optimization problems, which is not optimal and can lead to infeasibility. In this paper we present a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) scheme for ILMs. The scheme requires solving only a single optimization problem. It can guarantee constraints satisfaction and is capable of compensating for parasitic forces. Simulation results are presented for demonstration.},

Unlike the first three generations of district heating, the development of 4GDH involves meeting the challenge of more energy efficient buildings as well as the integration of district heating into a future smart energy system based on renewable energy sources. Following a review of recent 4GDH research, the article quantifies the costs and benefits of 4GDH in future sustainable energy systems. Costs involve an upgrade of heating systems and of the operation of the distribution grids, while benefits are lower grid losses, a better utilization of low-temperature heat sources and improved efficiency in the production compared to previous district heating systems. It is quantified how benefits exceed costs by a safe margin with the benefits of systems integration being the most important.},

A system model of all vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) is established including the electric subsystem and hydraulic subsystem, and the accuracy and reliability of this system model are validated. The variation of pump efficiency with flow rate is considered in the proposed system model, which makes the predicted system efficiency and coulomb efficiency more accurate. A new control strategy of variable flow rate is proposed by giving a limitation region of the flow rate. In this new strategy, the coefficients of system model can be determined and adjusted according to the VRFB operating parameters, which can guarantee high system efficiency and coulomb efficiency simultaneously. In application of this new control strategy, the system efficiency and coulomb efficiency under variable flow rate strategy are always higher than that under constant flow rate, with 3.34% increasing for system efficiency and 3.84% increasing for coulomb efficiency by average.},

@article{Campbell2005,
abstract = {Agent-based modelling offers a way to break from the crude assumptions of mean-field type models, which ignore space correlations between elements of the system and replace local interactions with uniform long-range ones. Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) explicitly model spatially distributed individuals; however the richness of such a model can also be a liability due to the sensitive dependence of such high-dimensional systems. This has implications for choice of MAS architecture, programming of rules, confidence in predictions, and calibration of model parameters. Delay-embedding, also known as geometry from a time series, provides a deep theoretical foundation for the analysis of time series generated by nonlinear deterministic dynamical systems. The profound insight of embedding is that an accessible variable can explicitly retrieve unseen internal degrees of freedom. [3]. In the domain of complex systems modelling, however, there typically exist an abundance of observables, in which case reconstructing hidden degrees of freedom may be problematic or even nonsensical. Also, many observables often implies high dimensionality, which generally precludes a dynamical systems approach in the first instance. Uncautious use of delay-embedding, from which it is easy to get a result regardless of physical justification, has in the past led to a degree of negative press for this idea. However, the recent extensions of Takens' delay-embedding theorem to deterministically and stochastically forced systems [9, 8, 10] provide a rigorous framework in which to reconstruct using multiple observables. This holds great significance for pattern discovery in complex data series, which we define to be more than one series - spatial, temporal or a mixture - of an underlying complex system. In particular, the concept of a bundle embedding highlights a way to usefully employ the 'surplus' observables in the embedding process. More generally, forced embeddings provide a methodology to breakdown complex system data sets in a modular fashion, while still retaining nonlinear relationships. Cluster-Weighted Modelling is a sophisticated approach to density estimation that, when applied to the output of a delay-embedding process, is able to obtain a statistical representation of the dynamics. These two concepts - forced embeddings and density estimation - provide a promising theory and a practical probabilistic interpretation respectively to the 'inverse problem' of system identification. Expert-knowledge based MAS construction and density-estimation of delay-embedded data can therefore be thought of as two complementary approaches to the goal of bottom-up, complex systems modelling. The original contribution of this paper is to present the latter as a highly data-driven approach to MAS construction in its own right, and, perhaps more importantly, as an aid to constructing and calibrating the more expert-knowledge rule-driven approach. The emphasis is on a solid theoretical and conceptual foundation. To illustrate the feasibility of our approach, preliminary implementation results for an ecological modelling scenario are presented and discussed.},

The results show that the obtained controller guaranties robust stability and performance, thus allowing the battery to operate over a wide range of operating conditions.

abstract = {We propose model-plant mismatch learning offset-free model predictive control (MPC), which learns and applies the intrinsic model-plant mismatch, to effectively exploit the advantages of model-based and data-driven control strategies and overcome the limitations of each approach. In this study, the model-plant mismatch map on steady-state manifold in the controlled variable space is approximated via a general regression neural network from the steady-state data for each setpoint. Though the learned model-plant mismatch map can provide the information at the equilibrium point (i.e., setpoint), it cannot provide model-plant mismatch information during the transient state. Moreover, the intrinsic model-plant mismatch can vary due to system characteristics changes during operation. Therefore, we additionally apply a supplementary disturbance variable which is updated from the disturbance estimator based on the nominal offset-free MPC scheme. Then, the combined disturbance signal is applied to the target problem and finite-horizon optimal control problem of offset-free MPC to improve the prediction accuracy and closed-loop performance of the controller. By this, we can exploit both the learned model-plant mismatch information and the stabilizing property of the nominal disturbance estimator approach. The closed-loop simulation results demonstrate that the developed scheme can properly learn the intrinsic model-plant mismatch and efficiently improve the model-plant mismatch compensating performance in offset-free MPC. Moreover, we examine the robust asymptotic stability of the developed offset-free MPC scheme, which is known to be difficult to analyze in nominal offset-free MPC, by exploiting the learned model-plant mismatch information.},

Because the system dynamics are extremely sensitive to changes in refrigerant mass flow rate, accurate expansion valve and compressor models are essential to creating effective dynamic models. However, mass flow rate information is not commonly available for installed systems. This work presents models for electronic and thermostatic expansion valves (EEVs and TEVs), evaporators, and compressors. An integrated approach is used to identify model parameters using only temperature and pressure sensors. Two numerical search algorithms, nonlinear least squares and simplex search, are used to estimate the parameters, and the approach is validated on three distinct experimental systems. These techniques are enabling tools for creating effective models for dynamic analysis, control design, and fault detection. An additional contribution of this work is the quantitative validation of a simple model of a TEV-controlled system, which has been lacking in the literature. {\textcopyright} 2011 ASHRAE.},

In the present work, time dependent consumer data from the Naestved district heating system was used to investigate the ability of modelling tools to represent the temperature profile distortion throughout an entire heating system network. The Naestved district heating subsystem was modelled by two approaches (the node method developed at the Technical University of Denmark and the software TERMIS), and these modelling results were compared with measured data. The results indicate that the discrepancies between the predicted and measured temperatures are pronounced for consumers located in pipelines at distant pipelines containing numerous bends and fittings. Additionally, it was found that representing the consumer behaviour on an annual average basis introduced a deviation between the predicted and the measured return temperatures at the heat source. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Because of the limited knowledge of certain system parameters and the difficulty of developing and implementing effective model-based control strategies, the problem of determining the optimal value for the VCC high pressure that leads to the maximum system performance is here faced by means of a model-free approach. More specifically, an Extremum Seeking Control (ESC) scheme, which can search for the unknown or slowly varying optimum input with respect to a certain performance index, is adopted. In particular, thanks to the availability of an unusual test rig, different CO2 system configurations, i.e. a refrigeration system and a heat pump unit, have been tested. In this scenario, the performances of the ESC have been compared with those provided by the Liao's correlation, which is well-known in the literature.},

abstract = {We present a systematic delay-adaptive prediction-based control design for nonlinear systems with unknown long actuator delay. Our approach is based on the representation of the constant actuator delay as a transport Partial Differential Equation (PDE) in which the convective speed is inversely proportional to the unknown delay. We study two different frameworks, assuming first that the actuator state is measured and relaxing afterward. For the full-state feedback case, we prove global asymptotic convergence of the proposed adaptive controller while, in the second case, replacing the actuator state by its adaptive estimate, we prove local regulation. The relevance of the obtained results are illustrated by simulations of a biological activator/repressor system. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

@article{Stark1999,
abstract = {Takens Embedding Theorem forms the basis of virtually all approaches to the analysis of time series generated by nonlinear deterministic dynamical systems. It typically allows us to reconstruct an unknown dynamical system that gives rise to a given observed scalar time series simply by constructing a new state space out of successive values of the time series. This provides the theoretical foundation for many popular techniques, including those for the measurement of fractal dimensions and Liapunov exponents, for the prediction of future behaviour, for noise reduction and signal separation, and most recently for control and targeting. Current versions of Takens Theorem assume that the underlying system is autonomous. Unfortunately this is not the case for many real systems; in the laboratory we often force an experimental system in order for it to exhibit interesting behaviour, whilst in the case of naturally occurring systems it is very rare for us to be able to isolate the system to ensure that there are no external influences. In this paper we therefore prove two versions of Takens Theorem relevant to forced systems: one applicable to the case where the forcing is unknown, and the other to the situation where we are able to determine independently the state of the forcing system (usually because we are responsible for the forcing ourselves). In a subsequent paper we shall show how to extend these results to give an analogue of Takens Theorem for randomly forced systems, leading to a new framework for the analysis of time series arising from nonlinear stochastic systems.},

abstract = {Fast and efficient numerical methods for solving Quadratic Programming problems (QPs) in the area of Model Predictive Control (MPC) exist nowadays in so many variations that choosing the right solver for a specific application is no longer a trivial procedure. Although active-set and interior-point methods have monopolized the interest of control engineers over the past few decades, research in first-order methods has been recently revived and several algorithms based on Yurii Nesterov's fast gradient method (FGM) [34] have emerged. Some of the properties that contributed to this development is the simplicity of the algorithmic scheme, the guaranteed convergence rates and the ability to compute small to medium accuracy solutions in high sampling rates [23]. Following the growing interest in the field, the purpose of this Thesis is to provide a detailed overview of first-order solvers under a unifying framework and analyze their computational complexity in nonlinear MPC applications, where the generated QPs may comprise time-varying data. The results of the complexity analysis are then used as a guide to design an efficient MPC controller for an industrial example of ABB Corporate Research. iii},

The overall system simulation model was used to design a MIMO controller based on the linear-quadratic Gaussian method using a state observer of the Kalman filter type. A purpose-built testing apparatus comprised of a variable-speed compressor and a pulse-width modulated expansion valve was used to collect data for the system identification and model validation exercises. It was found that the model reproduces the experimental trends of the working pressures in conditions far from the operation point (±30%) with a maximum deviation of ±5%.

If n is an integer larger than twice the box-counting dimension of A, then almost every map from Rk to Rn, in the sense of prevalence, is one-to-one on A, and moreover is an embedding on smooth manifolds contained within A. If A is a chaotic attractor of a typical dynamical system, then the same is true for almost every delay-coordinate map from Rk to Rn. These results are extended in two other directions. Similar results are proved in the more general case of reconstructions which use moving averages of delay coordinates.

However, previous control strategies under-utilize a degree of freedom corresponding to the amount of refrigerant in the system, which is related to condenser subcooling and can significantly affect system efficiency. In this paper, an alternative system architecture, which utilizes a receiver and an additional electronic expansion valve, is used to provide independent control of condenser subcooling. Simulation and experimental results show there exists an optimal subcooling which maximizes system efficiency; however, this optimal subcooling changes with operating conditions. Therefore, extremum seeking control is implemented to find the optimal subcooling in an adaptive, model-free manner. Experimental results demonstrate a 9% increase in efficiency using the alternative architecture and extremum seeking control. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd and IIR. All rights reserved.},

A monitoring system based on IoT sensors provides data on indoor climate in the rooms and on the heat load of the building. Using this data, we estimate unknown states and parameters of a model of the building's heating system using the maximum likelihood method. Important novelties of this paper include models of the water flow in the circuit and the state of the valves in the radiator thermostats. The non-linear model accurately predicts the indoor air temperature, return water temperature and heat load. The ideas behind the model lay a foundation for GB models of buildings that use different kinds of water-based heating systems such as air-to-water/water-to-water heat pumps. Such GB models enable model predictive control to control e.g. the indoor air climate or provide flexibility services.},

The conventional single-input single-output (SISO) control was shown to have very limited performance. A low order lumped-parameter model was developed to describe the significant dynamics of vapor compression cycles. Dynamic modes were analyzed based on the low order model to provide physical insight of system dynamic behavior. To synthesize a MIMO control system, the Linear-Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) technique was applied to coordinate compressor speed and expansion valve opening with guaranteed stability robustness in the design. Furthermore, to control a vapor compression cycle over a wide range of operating conditions where system nonlinearities become evident, a gain scheduling scheme was used so that the MIMO controller could adapt to changing operating conditions. Both analytical studies and experimental tests showed that the MIMO control could significantly improve the transient behavior of vapor compression cycles compared to the conventional SISO control scheme. The MIMO control proposed in this paper could be extended to the control of vapor compression cycles in a variety of HVAC and refrigeration applications to improve system performance and energy efficiency. {\textcopyright} 1998 American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc.},

The controlled output variables of the refrigeration system are the cooling power managed through the outlet temperature of the evaporator and the superheating degree at the condenser. The input variables of the system are the valve opening and the compressor speed. System identification is performed by applying stepped signals to the input variables, resulting in four transfer functions estimated with a Box-Jenkins model. From the MIMO system transfer functions, the relative gain array is calculated to determinate the best variables to be paired. After that, according to the variables to be paired, the corresponding transfer functions are reduced to order two to design a PID controller for each output variable employing the internal model control technique. Then, the controllers are contrasted employing a set of quantitative performance indexes with the control results achieved in the PID18 workshop. Obtained results show that the proposed Internal Model controllers have better performance than most of the proposed controllers at the PID18.},

abstract = {Data assimilation, which relies on explicit knowledge of dynamical models, is a well-known approach that addresses models' limitations due to various reasons, such as errors in input and forcing data sets. This approach, however, requires intensive computational efforts, especially for high-dimensional systems such as distributed hydrological models. Alternatively, data-driven methods offer comparable solutions when the physics underlying the models are unknown. For the first time in a hydrological context, a nonparametric framework is implemented here to improve model estimates using available observations. This method uses Takens delay coordinate method to reconstruct the dynamics of the system within a Kalman filtering framework, called the Kalman-Takens filter. A synthetic experiment is undertaken to fully investigate the capability of the proposed method by comparing its performance with that of a standard assimilation framework based on an adaptive unscented Kalman filter (AUKF). Furthermore, using terrestrial water storage (TWS) estimates obtained from the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment mission, both filters are applied to a real case scenario to update different water storages over Australia. In situ groundwater and soil moisture measurements within Australia are used to further evaluate the results. The Kalman-Takens filter successfully improves the estimated water storages at levels comparable to the AUKF results, with an average root-mean-square error reduction of 37.30% for groundwater and 12.11% for soil moisture estimates. Additionally, the Kalman-Takens filter, while reducing estimation complexities, requires a fraction of the computational time, that is, ∼8 times faster compared to the AUKF approach.},

While this picture has fueled our field for a century, it has shown difficulties in handling high-dimensional, ill-described, and uncertain systems, which are more and more common in engineered systems design and analysis of "big data" measurements. This overview article presents an alternative framework for dynamical systems, based on the "dynamics of observables" picture. The central object is the Koopman operator: an infinite-dimensional, linear operator that is nonetheless capable of capturing the full nonlinear dynamics. The first goal of this paper is to make it clear how methods that appeared in different papers and contexts all relate to each other through spectral properties of the Koopman operator. The second goal is to present these methods in a concise manner in an effort to make the framework accessible to researchers who would like to apply them, but also, expand and improve them. Finally, we aim to provide a road map through the literature where each of the topics was described in detail. We describe three main concepts: Koopman mode analysis, Koopman eigenquotients, and continuous indicators of ergodicity. For each concept we provide a summary of theoretical concepts required to define and study them, numerical methods that have been developed for their analysis, and, when possible, applications that made use of them. The Koopman framework is showing potential for crossing over from academic and theoretical use to industrial practice. Therefore, the paper highlights its strengths, in applied and numerical contexts. Additionally, we point out areas where an additional research push is needed before the approach is adopted as an off-the-shelf framework for analysis and design. A majority of methods from dynamical systems analysis, especially those in applied settings , rely on Poincar{\'{e}}'s geometric picture that focuses on "dynamics of states". While this picture has fueled our field for a century, it has shown difficulties in handling high-dimensional, ill-described, and uncertain systems , which are more and more common in engineered systems design and analysis of "big data" measurements. This overview article presents an alternative framework for dynamical systems, based on the "dynam-ics of observables" picture. We present an overview of several approaches to studying dynamical systems using the Koopman operator , which holds promise to resolve these issues. The dynamics are analyzed by looking at evolutions of functions on the state space, rather than directly at state space trajecto-ries. The evolution can be understood by expanding the function into a basis of eigen-functions of the Koopman operator. The first a) We dedicate this paper to the memory of Jerrold E. (Jerry) Marsden whose support of our research was invaluable. approach is based on the Koopman modes, which generalize linear mode analysis from linear systems to nonlinear systems, while preserving global nonlinear features of the system, unlike, e.g., linearizations based on Taylor-and Fourier-expansions. The second approach identifies coherent structures in flows. An equivalence relation between points in the state space can be defined using spectral properties of the Koopman operator , where equivalent points correspond to initial conditions that behave statistically the same with respect to any observable. The third approach we present introduces continuous quantifications of ergodicity and mixing , concepts existing in ergodic theory that are traditionally treated as binary notions. Throughout the paper, we highlight examples from the literature using each of these concepts. Examples are taken from diverse areas such as fluid mechanics, fluid mixing, energy efficiency of buildings, power systems, and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle path-planning for search-and-rescue. A common trait of all the methods is that they do not require access to an analytical model of the system; the spectral properties of the Koopman operator},

abstract = {District heating networks have become widespread due to their ability to distribute thermal energy efficiently, which leads to reduced carbon emissions and improved air quality. Additional benefits can derive from novel demand side management strategies, which can efficiently balance demand and supply. However, their implementation requires detailed knowledge of heating network characteristics, which vary remarkably depending on urban layout and system amplitude. Moreover, extensive data about the energy distribution and thermal capacity of different areas are seldom available. For this purpose, the present work proposes a novel procedure to develop a fast scale-free model of large-scale district heating networks for system optimization and control. Each network community is represented and modeled as an aggregated region. Its physics-based model is identified starting from a limited amount of data available at the main substations and includes heat capacity and heat loss coefficients. The procedure is demonstrated and validated on the network of V{\"{a}}ster{\aa}s, Sweden, showing results that are in agreement with data from the literature. Thus, the model is well suited for real-time optimization and predictive control. In particular, the possibility to easily estimate the heat storage potential of network communities allows demand side management solutions to be applied in several conditions.},

abstract = {In recent years, methods for data-driven Koopman spectral analysis, such as Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), have become increasingly popular approaches for extracting dynamically relevant features from data sets. However to establish the connection between techniques like DMD or Extended DMD (EDMD) and the Koopman operator, assumptions are made about the nature of the supplied data. In particular, both methods assume the data were generated by an autonomous dynamical system, which can be limiting in certain experimental or computational settings, such as when system actuation is present. We present a modification of EDMD that overcomes this limitation by compensating for the effects of actuation, and is capable of recovering the leading Koopman eigenvalues, eigenfunctions, and modes of the unforced system. To highlight the efficacy of this approach, we apply it to two examples with (quasi)-periodic forcing: the first is the Duffing oscillator, which demonstrates eigenfunction approximation, and the second is a lattice Boltzmann code that approximates the FitzHugh-Nagumo partial differential equation and shows Koopman mode and eigenvalue computation.},

abstract = {Most of the existing district heating systems are second and third generation and operate with supply temperature above 80–100 °C. To meet long-term decarbonization targets, existing networks should be transformed into low-temperature systems in a cost-effective manner. This paper presents a critical review on the strategies that can be adopted to reduce the supply temperature in existing district heating networks taking advantage of previous studies (both research projects and scientific papers) and forerunner experiences. This includes a review of the constraints met during transition and the possible strategies/actions to overcome them, along with the actions to boost the change. The analysis shows that there is often significant room for improvement by exploiting the oversizing of network, substations and terminal units along with techniques, previously adopted with other aims, for a proper infrastructure/operation modification. Temperature reductions can be achieved without groundbreaking infrastructural modifications. Therefore, acting on specific subnetworks (the way usually adopted) is not the only way to proceed; this can be done in entire networks by adopting proper changes of perspective, policies and preliminary analysis. In the meantime, there is still need for specific approaches to estimate the main limitations and the corresponding best actions to implement in a specific network.},

abstract = {An accurate battery model is the prerequisite for reliable state estimate of vanadium redox battery (VRB). As the battery model parameters are time varying with operating condition variation and battery aging, the common methods where model parameters are empirical or prescribed offline lacks accuracy and robustness. To address this issue, this paper proposes to use an online adaptive battery model to reproduce the VRB dynamics accurately. The model parameters are online identified with both the recursive least squares (RLS) and the extended Kalman filter (EKF). Performance comparison shows that the RLS is superior with respect to the modeling accuracy, convergence property, and computational complexity. Based on the online identified battery model, an adaptive peak power estimator which incorporates the constraints of voltage limit, SOC limit and design limit of current is proposed to fully exploit the potential of the VRB. Experiments are conducted on a lab-scale VRB system and the proposed peak power estimator is verified with a specifically designed “two-step verification” method. It is shown that different constraints dominate the allowable peak power at different stages of cycling. The influence of prediction time horizon selection on the peak power is also analyzed.},

A nonlinear dynamic model is first developed to model the dynamic characteristic of TCRAE. The corresponding model linearization is carried out and the simulation results reproduce transient behavior of the nonlinear model very well. Based on the developed model, an optimal multivariable controller with a tracker based linear quadratic state feedback algorithm and a predictor using steepest descent method is designed. The controller is finally applied on the experimental apparatus and the performance is verified. Using the tracker only, the gas cooler pressure and chilled water outlet temperature (cooling capacity) are well tracked rejecting the disturbances from each other. Furthermore, by the predictor, the optimal gas cooler pressure for a constant cooling capacity is actually approached on the experimental apparatus with a settling time about 700 s.},

abstract = {The Koopman operator is a linear but infinite-dimensional operator that governs the evolution of scalar observables defined on the state space of an autonomous dynamical system and is a powerful tool for the analysis and decomposition of nonlinear dynamical systems. In this manuscript, we present a data-driven method for approximating the leading eigenvalues, eigenfunctions, and modes of the Koopman operator. The method requires a data set of snapshot pairs and a dictionary of scalar observables, but does not require explicit governing equations or interaction with a “black box” integrator. We will show that this approach is, in effect, an extension of dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), which has been used to approximate the Koopman eigenvalues and modes. Furthermore, if the data provided to the method are generated by a Markov process instead of a deterministic dynamical system, the algorithm approximates the eigenfunctions of the Kolmogorov backward equation, which could be considered as the “stochastic Koopman operator” (Mezic in Nonlinear Dynamics 41(1–3): 309–325, 2005). Finally, four illustrative examples are presented: two that highlight the quantitative performance of the method when presented with either deterministic or stochastic data and two that show potential applications of the Koopman eigenfunctions.},

The outdoor temperature, together with the social behaviour of the consumers, have the greatest influence on the demand. This is also the core of the load prediction model developed in this paper. Several methodologies have been proposed for heat-load forecasting, but due to lack in measured data and due to the uncertainties that are present in the weather forecasts, many of them will fail in practice.

For example, noncontrollable mathematical models of real systems have subspaces that influence model behavior, but cannot be controlled by an input. Such subspaces can be difficult to determine in complex nonlinear networks. Since almost all of the present theory was developed for linear networks without symmetries, here we present a numerical and group representational framework, to quantify the observability and controllability of nonlinear networks with explicit symmetries that shows the connection between symmetries and nonlinear measures of observability and controllability. We numerically observe and theoretically predict that not all symmetries have the same effect on network observation and control. Our analysis shows that the presence of symmetry in a network may decrease observability and controllability, although networks containing only rotational symmetries remain controllable and observable. These results alter our view of the nature of observability and controllability in complex networks, change our understanding of structural controllability, and affect the design of mathematical models to observe and control such networks.},

The main global conclusions are low utilisation of district heating in buildings, varying implementation rates with respect to countries, moderate commitment to the fundamental idea of district heating, low recognition of possible carbon dioxide emission reductions, and low awareness in general of the district heating and cooling benefits. The cold deliveries from district cooling systems are much smaller than heat deliveries from district heating systems. The European situation can be characterised by higher commitment to the fundamental idea of district heating, lower specific carbon dioxide emissions, and higher awareness of the district heating and cooling benefits. The conclusions obtained from the six contexts analysed show that district heating and cooling systems have strong potentials to be viable heat and cold supply options in a future world. However, more efforts are required for identification, assessment, and implementation of these potentials in order to harvest the global benefits with district heating and cooling.},

abstract = {Takens' theorem (1981) shows how lagged variables of a single time series can be used as proxy variables to reconstruct an attractor for an underlying dynamic process. State space reconstruction (SSR) from single time series has been a powerful approach for the analysis of the complex, non-linear systems that appear ubiquitous in the natural and human world. The main shortcoming of these methods is the phenomenological nature of attractor reconstructions. Moreover, applied studies show that these single time series reconstructions can often be improved ad hoc by including multiple dynamically coupled time series in the reconstructions, to provide a more mechanistic model. Here we provide three analytical proofs that add to the growing literature to generalize Takens' work and that demonstrate how multiple time series can be used in attractor reconstructions. These expanded results (Takens' theorem is a special case) apply to a wide variety of natural systems having parallel time series observations for variables believed to be related to the same dynamic manifold. The potential information leverage provided by multiple embeddings created from different combinations of variables (and their lags) can pave the way for new applied techniques to exploit the time-limited, but parallel observations of natural systems, such as coupled ecological systems, geophysical systems, and financial systems. This paper aims to justify and help open this potential growth area for SSR applications in the natural sciences. {\textcopyright} 2011 Deyle, Sugihara.},

This facilitates researchers to test their recent developments in the design of PID controllers on a challenging control problem. The paper focuses on the control of refrigeration systems: the canonical vapour-compression cycle is first described and then the MIMO control problem selected for the Benchmark PID 2018 is addressed, where the cooling power (through the outlet temperature of the evaporator secondary fluid) is intended to be controlled, as well as the degree of superheating at the evaporator outlet, using the compressor speed and the expansion valve opening as manipulated variables. The control systems described in this paper are ready to test other multivariable control strategies, despite being focused on PID regulators. Full documentation about the Benchmark was linked on the website of PID'18 and it will remain in http://www.dia.uned.es/$\sim$fmorilla/benchmarkPID2018/.},

@article{Andersson2019,
abstract = {We present CasADi, an open-source software framework for numerical optimization. CasADi is a general-purpose tool that can be used to model and solve optimization problems with a large degree of flexibility, larger than what is associated with popular algebraic modeling languages such as AMPL, GAMS, JuMP or Pyomo. Of special interest are problems constrained by differential equations, i.e. optimal control problems. CasADi is written in self-contained C++, but is most conveniently used via full-featured interfaces to Python, MATLAB or Octave. Since its inception in late 2009, it has been used successfully for academic teaching as well as in applications from multiple fields, including process control, robotics and aerospace. This article gives an up-to-date and accessible introduction to the CasADi framework, which has undergone numerous design improvements over the last 7 years.},

@article{Zhang2019,
abstract = {Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a popular technique for modal decomposition, flow analysis, and reduced-order modeling. In situations where a system is time varying, one would like to update the system's description online as time evolves. This work provides an efficient method for computing DMD in real time, updating the approximation of a system's dynamics as new data becomes available. The algorithm does not require storage of past data, and computes the exact DMD matrix using rank-1 updates. A weighting factor that places less weight on older data can be incorporated in a straightforward manner, making the method particularly well suited to time-varying systems. A variant of the method may also be applied to online computation of "windowed DMD", in which only the most recent data are used. The efficiency of the method is compared against several existing DMD algorithms: for problems in which the state dimension is less than about$\sim$200, the proposed algorithm is the most efficient for real-time computation, and it can be orders of magnitude more efficient than the standard DMD algorithm. The method is demonstrated on several examples, including a time-varying linear system and a more complex example using data from a wind tunnel experiment. In particular, we show that the method is effective at capturing the dynamics of surface pressure measurements in the flow over a flat plate with an unsteady separation bubble.},

@article{Yeung2018,
abstract = {In this paper, we consider the problem of quantifying controllability and observability of a nonlinear discrete time dynamical system. We introduce the Koopman operator as a canonical representation of the system and apply a lifting technique to compute gramians in the space of full-state observables. We illustrate the properties of these gramians and identify several relationships with canonical results on local controllability and observability. Once defined, we show that these gramians can be balanced through a change of coordinates on the observables space, which in turn allows for direct application of balanced truncation. Throughout the paper, we highlight the aspects of our approach with an example nonlinear system.},

@article{Rowley2009,
abstract = {We present a technique for describing the global behaviour of complex nonlinear flows by decomposing the flow into modes determined from spectral analysis of the Koopman operator, an infinite-dimensional linear operator associated with the full nonlinear system. These modes, referred to as Koopman modes, are associated with a particular observable, and may be determined directly from data (either numerical or experimental) using a variant of a standard Arnoldi method. They have an associated temporal frequency and growth rate and may be viewed as a nonlinear generalization of global eigenmodes of a linearized system. They provide an alternative to proper orthogonal decomposition, and in the case of periodic data the Koopman modes reduce to a discrete temporal Fourier transform. The Arnoldi method used for computations is identical to the dynamic mode decomposition recently proposed by Schmid & Sesterhenn (Sixty-First Annual Meeting of the APS Division of Fluid Dynamics, 2008), so dynamic mode decomposition can be thought of as an algorithm for finding Koopman modes. We illustrate the method on an example of a jet in crossflow, and show that the method captures the dominant frequencies and elucidates the associated spatial structures. {\textcopyright} 2009 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = {We consider parameter estimation in non-linear state space models by using expectation-maximization based numerical approximations to likelihood maximization. We present a unified view of approximative EM algorithms that use either sigma-point or particle smoothers to evaluate the integrals involved in the expectation step of the EM method, and compare these methods to direct likelihood maximization. For models that are linear in parameters and have additive noise, we show how the maximization step of the EM algorithm is available in closed form. We compare the methods using simulated data, and discuss the differences between the approximations.},
