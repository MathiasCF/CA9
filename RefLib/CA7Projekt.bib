abstract = {This paper presents an updated and comprehensive description of offset-free MPC algorithms for nonlinear (and linear) discrete-time systems, with the intended objectives of clarifying the main concepts, showing new results, highlighting subtleties by means of challenging applications. First, the offset-free tracking problem for nonlinear systems is presented, putting a strong accent on the role of the disturbance model and observer, and then novel and stronger offset-free estimation results are presented. Next, recent advances in linear offset-free MPC are described, which show the equivalence of the velocity form algorithm (so far considered an alternative method) to a particular disturbance model and observer. Then, the concepts of offset-free estimation are exploited to design an offset-free economic MPC algorithm, which can asymptotically achieve the highest economic performance despite persistent model errors and disturbances. Extensive application results are presented to show the benefits of offsetfree MPC algorithms over standard ones, and to clarify misconceptions and design errors that can prevent constraint satisfaction, closed-loop stability, and offset-free performance.},

@article{Sheth2007,
abstract = {Despite the increasing number of WiFi-based Long Distance (WILD) network deployments, there is a lack of understanding of how WILD networks perform in practice. In this paper, we perform a systematic study to investigate the commonly cited sources of packet loss induced by the wireless channel and by the 802.11 MAC protocol. The channel induced losses that we study are external WiFi, nonWiFi and multipath interference. The protocol induced losses that we study are protocol timeouts and the breakdown of CSMA over WiLD links. Our results are based on measurements performed on two real-world WILD deployments and a wireless channel emulator. The two deployments allow us to compare measurements across rural and urban settings. The channel emulator allows us to study each source of packet loss in isolation in a controlled environment. Based on our experiments we observe that the presence of external WiFi interference leads to significant amount of packet loss in WILD links. In addition to identifying the sources of packet loss, we analyze the loss variability across time. We also explore the solution space and propose a range of MAC and network layer adaptation algorithms to mitigate the channel and protocol induced losses. The key lessons from this study were also used in the design of a TDMA based MAC protocol for high performance long distance multihop wireless networks [12]. {\textcopyright} 2007 IEEE.},

abstract = {Modern water distribution networks (WDNs) are complex and difficult to manage due to increased level of urbanization, varying consumer demands, ageing infrastructure, operational costs, and inadequate water resources. The management problems in such complex networks may be classified into short-term, medium-term, and long-term, depending on the duration at which the problems are solved or considered. To address the management problems associated with WDNs, mathematical models facilitate analysis and improvement of the performance of water infrastructure at minimum operational cost, and have been used by researchers, water utility managers, and operators. This paper presents a detailed review of the management problems and essential mathematical models that are used to address these problems at various phases of WDNs. In addition, it also discusses the main approaches to address these management problems to meet customer demands at the required pressure in terms of adequate water quantity and quality. Key challenges that are associated with the management of WDNs are discussed. Also, new directions for future research studies are suggested to enable water utility managers and researchers to improve the performance of water distribution networks.},

abstract = {The PI/PID controller is the most used controller in industry. However, for processes with large time delays, the common belief is that PI and PID controllers have sluggish performance, and that a Smith predictor or similar dead-time compensator can give much improved performance. We claim in this paper that this is a myth. For a given robustness level in terms of the peak sensitivity (Ms), we find that the performance improvement with the Smith predictor is small even for a pure time delay process. For other first-order processes a PID controller is generally better for a given robustness level. In addition, the Smith Predictor is much more sensitive to time delay errors than pi and pid controllers.},

WDSs are modeled using the Darcy–Weisbach equation with the Swamee–Jain equation. However, the Swamee–Jain equation approximates the Colebrook–White equation, errors of which are within 1% for ϵ/D∈[10−6,10−2] and Re∈[5000,108]. A formulation is presented for the solution of WDSs using the Colebrook–White equation. The correctness and efficacy of the head formulation have been demonstrated by applying it to six WDSs with the number of pipes ranges from 454 to 157,044 and the number of nodes ranges from 443 to 150,630. The addition of a physically and fundamentally more accurate WDS solution method can improve the quality of the results achieved in both academic research and industrial application, such as contamination source identification, water hammer analysis, WDS network calibration, sensor placement, and least-cost design and operation of WDSs.},

abstract = {The stochastic nature of water consumption patterns during the day and week varies. Therefore, to continually provide water to consumers with appropriate quality, quantity and pressure, water utilities require accurate and appropriate short-term water demand (STWD) forecasts. In view of this, an overview of forecasting methods for STWD prediction is presented. Based on that, a comparative assessment of the performance of alternative forecasting models from the different methods is studied. Times series models (i.e., autoregressive (AR), moving average (MA), autoregressive-moving average (ARMA), and ARMA with exogenous variable (ARMAX)) introduced by Box and Jenkins (1970), feed-forward back-propagation neural network (FFBP-NN), and hybrid model (i.e., combined forecasts from ARMA and FFBP-NN) are compared with each other for a common set of data. Akaike information criterion (AIC), originally proposed by Akaike (1974) is used to estimate the quality of each short-term forecasting model. Furthermore, Nash–Sutcliffe (NS) model efficiency coefficient proposed by Nash–Sutcliffe (1970), root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) are the forecasting statistical terms used to assess the predictive performance of the models. Lastly, as regards the selection of an accurate and appropriate STWD forecasting model, this paper provides recommendations and future work based on the forecasts generated by each of the predictive models considered.},

abstract = {Automatic burst and leak detection in water distribution systems plays an important role in water saving and management. This research develops a novel burst detection method of using adaptive Kalman filtering on hydraulic measurements of flow and pressure at district meter area (DMA) level. Adaptive Kalman filtering is used to model normal water usage (or alternatively water pressure), so the residual of the filter (e.g., the difference between the predicted flow and the measured flow) represents the amount of abnormal water usage relating to the bursts (or newly occurred leaks) in the downstream network. The results from a series of engineered tests which simulated flushing show that the size of the bursts and leaks strongly correlates with the residual of the filter. Finally, the method was applied to data from several real DMAs in the north of England, and the results show that the detected bursts correspond well to known historical operational information such as customer complaints' records and work management (repair) data. The results suggest that flow measurement data are more sensitive to a burst or leak than the pressure measurement data. {\textcopyright} 2011 ASCE.},

@article{Walski2001,
abstract = {Learning how to model a water distribution system is a complicated task. Understanding how to operate a modeling program is a minor part of the overall picture. To effectively use models, the engineer must be able to link knowledge of basic hydraulic theory and the mechanics of the program with that of the operation of real-world systems. The purpose of this book is to provide a practical resource for engineers and modelers that goes well beyond being a how-to guide for typing data into a computer program. It contains straightforward answers to common questions related both to modeling and to distribution systems in general. The scope of this text includes such topics as: - Definitions and industry standards - Model assembly and verification - Effective use of models as decision-support tools - Recent innovations in modeling The method in which these issues are approached is designed to be readily accessible for immediate application by practicing engineers, while sufficiently comprehensive for student use. Continuing Education and Problem Sets Included in this text are approximately 100 hydraulics and modeling problems to give students and professionals the opportunity to apply the material covered in each chapter. The accompanying CD-ROM in the back of the book contains an academic version of Haestad Methods' WaterCAD, which can be used to solve many of the problems, as well as data files with much of the given information in the problems pre-entered.},

abstract = {Centrifugal pumps are used in a variety of different applications, such as water supply, wastewater, and different industrial applications. Some pump installations are crucial for the applications to work. Failures can lead to substantial economic losses and can influence the life of many people when they occur. Therefore, detection of faults, if possible in an early stage, and isolation of their causes are of great interest. Especially fault detection, which can be used for predictive maintenance, can decrease working expenses and increase the reliability of the application in which the pump is placed. The topic of this work is Fault Detection and Identification in centrifugal pumps. Different approaches are developed with special focus on robustness. Robustness with respect to disturbances, unknown parts of the system, and parameter variations are considered. All developed algorithms are tested on an industrial test setup, showing the usability of the algorithms on a real centrifugal pump.},

@article{Johnson1971,
abstract = {Modern linear regulator and servomechanism theories (of the deterministic type) either ignore system disturbances altogether or assume they can be represented by initial conditions on the plant state vector. Controllers designed by such theories may fail to meet performance specifications when the system is subjected to persistently acting disturbances. In this paper, we show how one can modify existing regulator and servomechanism theories to take into account the presence of persistent fluctuating disturbances. By this means one can design a deterministic controller which consistently maintains set-point regulation, or servotracking, in the face of a broad class of realistic external disturbances. In addition, we show how one can systematically exploit any useful effects that may be present in the action of external disturbances.
