@article{Rasmussen2005,
abstract = {This brief uses an air conditioning system to illustrate the benefits of iteratively combining first principles and system identification techniques to develop control-oriented models of complex systems. A transcritical vapor compression system is initially modeled with first principles and then verified with experimental data. Both single-input-single-output (SISO) and multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) system identification techniques are then used to construct locally linear models. Motivated by the ability to capture the salient dynamic characteristics with low-order identified models, the physical model is evaluated for essentially nonminimal dynamics. A singular perturbation model reduction approach is then applied to obtain a minimal representation of the dynamics more suitable for control design, and yielding insight to the underlying system dynamics previously unavailable in the literature. The results demonstrate that iteratively modeling a complex system with first principles and system identification techniques gives greater confidence in the first principles model, and better understanding of the underlying physical dynamics. Although this iterative process requires more time and effort, significant insight and model improvements can be realized. {\textcopyright} 2005 IEEE.},

This is a MIMO process, where the expansion valve opening and the compressor speed are used as manipulated variables, whereas the control of both the outlet temperature of evaporator secondary flux and the superheating degree of refrigerant at evaporator outlet is intended. After the identification of the system at several operating points, a controllability analysis is carried out and a multivariable robust H∞ controller is designed, using the S/KS/T Mixed Sensitivity Problem approach. Simulation results concerning reference tracking, coupling measurement and disturbance rejection are included, comparing the H∞ controller to a decentralised PID one. Better closed-loop performance of the robust controller and reduced coupling between controlled variables are observed, as well as agreement with the controllability analysis conclusions regarding rise time bounds. A versatile experimental plant designed and set up by the authors is also described. As future work it is expected that identification and comparison between simulation and actual results can be achieved.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new lumped-parameter model for describing the dynamics of vapor compression cycles. In particular, the dynamics associated with the two heat exchangers, i.e. the evaporator and the condenser, are modeled based on a moving-interface approach by which the position of the two-phase/single-phase interface inside the one-dimensional heat exchanger can be properly predicted. This interface information has never been included in previous lumped-parameter models developed for control design purpose, although it is essential in predicting the refrigerant superheat or subcool value. This model relates critical performance outputs, such as evaporating pressure, condensing pressure, and superheat, to actuating inputs including compressor speed, fan speed, and expansion valve opening. In view of regulating multiple performance outputs in modern heat pumps and air conditioning systems, this model is highly useful for design of multivariable feedback control.},

abstract = {Control of food processes involving vapor compression cycles as actuators is often a difficult task: indeed this particular device is itself a complex process including coupled unit operations as evaporation, compression, condensation and expansion. Nevertheless, an accurate control of heat transfer rate is often essential for global quality of product and stability of flow in exchangers. Moreover a number of vapor compression systems are already equipped with variable speed-compressors and fans. However, due to lack of knowledge about the dynamic behavior of these systems, the industry has not taken full advantage of these variable devices to get substantial control performance improvement. This paper presents a lumped-parameter model for describing the dynamics of vapor compression cycles. Based on moving-boundary approach for the description of two-phase/single phase interface inside the heat exchangers, this low-order model composed of only ordinary differential equations can be highly useful for design of control strategies. This model has been validated on an experimental device and a good agreement between measurements and computed data has been found. Use of this model in food process control design is discussed.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach for identifying critical parameters in dynamic vapor compression system models using limited sensor information. Because the system dynamics are extremely sensitive to changes in refrigerant mass flow rate, accurate expansion valve and compressor models are essential to creating effective dynamic models. However, mass flow rate information is not commonly available for installed systems. This work presents models for electronic and thermostatic expansion valves (EEVs and TEVs), evaporators, and compressors. An integrated approach is used to identify model parameters using only temperature and pressure sensors. Two numerical search algorithms, nonlinear least squares and simplex search, are used to estimate the parameters, and the approach is validated on three distinct experimental systems. These techniques are enabling tools for creating effective models for dynamic analysis, control design, and fault detection. An additional contribution of this work is the quantitative validation of a simple model of a TEV-controlled system, which has been lacking in the literature. {\textcopyright} 2011 ASHRAE.},

A general purpose optimal control problem (OCP) solver Matlab toolbox called RIOTS is used as the OCP solver for the proposed MPC scheme which allows for straightforward implementation of the method and for solving a wide range of constrained linear and nonlinear optimal control problems. A conditional integral (CI) compensator is embedded in the controller to compensate for the small steady state errors. This method shows significant improvements in performance compared to both discrete decentralized control (C1) and multi-variable PID controller (C2) originally given in PID2018 Benchmark Challenge as a baseline. Our solution is introduced in detail in this paper and our final results using the overall relative index, J, are 0.2 over C1 and 0.3 over C2, respectively. In other words, we achieved 80% improvement over C1 and 70% improvement over C2. We expect to achieve further improvements when some optimized searching efforts are used for MPC and CI parameter tuning.},

abstract = {In this paper, the energy-efficient operation of single-stage refrigerating carbon dioxide vapour compressor units operating in transcritical and subcritical conditions is discussed from an experimental point of view. The performance of this kind of systems strongly depends on the operating conditions and in particular on the vapour compression cycle (VCC) high pressure. Because of the limited knowledge of certain system parameters and the difficulty of developing and implementing effective model-based control strategies, the problem of determining the optimal value for the VCC high pressure that leads to the maximum system performance is here faced by means of a model-free approach. More specifically, an Extremum Seeking Control (ESC) scheme, which can search for the unknown or slowly varying optimum input with respect to a certain performance index, is adopted. In particular, thanks to the availability of an unusual test rig, different CO2 system configurations, i.e. a refrigeration system and a heat pump unit, have been tested. In this scenario, the performances of the ESC have been compared with those provided by the Liao's correlation, which is well-known in the literature.},

However, previous control strategies under-utilize a degree of freedom corresponding to the amount of refrigerant in the system, which is related to condenser subcooling and can significantly affect system efficiency. In this paper, an alternative system architecture, which utilizes a receiver and an additional electronic expansion valve, is used to provide independent control of condenser subcooling. Simulation and experimental results show there exists an optimal subcooling which maximizes system efficiency; however, this optimal subcooling changes with operating conditions. Therefore, extremum seeking control is implemented to find the optimal subcooling in an adaptive, model-free manner. Experimental results demonstrate a 9% increase in efficiency using the alternative architecture and extremum seeking control. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd and IIR. All rights reserved.},

A low order lumped-parameter model was developed to describe the significant dynamics of vapor compression cycles. Dynamic modes were analyzed based on the low order model to provide physical insight of system dynamic behavior. To synthesize a MIMO control system, the Linear-Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) technique was applied to coordinate compressor speed and expansion valve opening with guaranteed stability robustness in the design. Furthermore, to control a vapor compression cycle over a wide range of operating conditions where system nonlinearities become evident, a gain scheduling scheme was used so that the MIMO controller could adapt to changing operating conditions. Both analytical studies and experimental tests showed that the MIMO control could significantly improve the transient behavior of vapor compression cycles compared to the conventional SISO control scheme.

The controlled output variables of the refrigeration system are the cooling power managed through the outlet temperature of the evaporator and the superheating degree at the condenser. The input variables of the system are the valve opening and the compressor speed. System identification is performed by applying stepped signals to the input variables, resulting in four transfer functions estimated with a Box-Jenkins model. From the MIMO system transfer functions, the relative gain array is calculated to determinate the best variables to be paired. After that, according to the variables to be paired, the corresponding transfer functions are reduced to order two to design a PID controller for each output variable employing the internal model control technique. Then, the controllers are contrasted employing a set of quantitative performance indexes with the control results achieved in the PID18 workshop. Obtained results show that the proposed Internal Model controllers have better performance than most of the proposed controllers at the PID18.},
