abstract = {The vanadium redox flow battery (VRB) is one of the most promising technologies for large-scale energy storage. The control of the electrolyte flow rate during its operation has significant impacts on the overall efficiency of the storage system. Although flow-rate optimization under constant current conditions has been addressed in previous studies, few have dealt with varying (dis-)charge power conditions that are common in practice. In this study, an electrochemical model of the VRB has been developed, considering concentration overpotential and the required pump power consumption. The influence of the electrolyte flow rate on the stack efficiency is investigated, and an optimization framework is proposed for determining the optimal flow rate under varying (dis-)charge power conditions. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework could increase the stack efficiency by 3% and limit the electrolyte temperature increment not exceeding 1.4 K.},

abstract = {In this article, a gain scheduling approach is proposed to control the electrolyte flow rate for a VRB system. The flow rate is regulated to ensure that the open circuit voltage difference before and after cell stack tracks a given reference trajectory. The nonlinear process model is linearised around three different operating points with different state of charge. A set of PI controllers have been designed based on the linearised process model for both charging and discharging. To improve the control performance, a feedforward controller is designed to compensate the effect of current fluctuations.

abstract = {Large scale energy storage systems have received much attention for the mitigation of the intermittence of renewable energy power generation. Among such systems, vanadium redox flow battery (VRB) is one of the promising approach in application of power grids due to the advantages of safe and reliable operation, flexible design and long cycle life. For the purpose of control and state estimation, it is necessary to establish a suitable mathematical model to describe its dynamic characteristics. The traditional electrical model does not consider the concentration overpotential and pump loss of the battery. This paper develops an electrical equivalent circuit model of vanadium redox flow battery that takes pump loss into account. The proposed model considers the ohmic loss, self-discharge phenomenon, concentration overpotential and pump loss in the battery. Pump loss can reflect the effect of electrolyte flow rate on the performance of vanadium redox batteries. The experiment shows that the pump power loss increases with the increase of electrolyte flow rate. By designing experiments and using genetic algorithms to identify the parameters in the proposed model, the simulation results of the parameter identification results are compared with the experimental data to verify the model.},

abstract = {For an operating flow battery system, how the battery's performance varies with ambient temperatures is of practical interest. To gain an understanding of the general thermal behavior of vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs), we devised and tested a laboratory-scale single VRFB by varying the operating temperature. The voltage efficiency of the VRFB is found to increase from 86.5% to 90.5% at 40mA/cm2 when the operating temperature is increased from 15°C to 55°C. The peak discharge power density is also observed to increase from 259.5mW/cm2 to 349.8mW/cm2 at the same temperature increment. The temperature increase, however, leads to a slight decrease in the coulombic efficiency from 96.2% to 93.7% at the same temperature increments. In addition, the capacity degradation rate is found to be higher at higher temperatures.},

abstract = {Vanadium redox flow battery (VRB) have a wide range of applications in renewable energy power generation, intelligent microgrids, and other fields due to their good safety and long cycle life. The internal parameters of vanadium redox flow battery will change in real time during operation. In order to ensure the reliable operation of the battery, an accurate electrical model needs to be established to monitor and predict the battery status in real time. In this paper, an RC equivalent model is established for vanadium redox flow battery, and the parameters are identified based on the model. In order to overcome the shortcomings of recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm, which is prone to data saturation and not tracking the time-varying parameters, this paper proposes a model parameter identification method based on the multiple innovation recursive least squares (MIRLS) algorithm. Based on the data collected in the pulse charging experiment, RLS and MIRLS algorithms were used to identify the model parameters. The experiments were performed on Wuhan University of Technology's 5kW / 3kWh VRB experimental platform, and the results show that the MIRLS algorithm has better convergence and accuracy in tracking time-varying parameters.},

abstract = {A 0-D dynamic mathematical model for a single Vanadium Redox Flow Battery (VRFB) cell is proposed. The model is based on the conservation principles of charge and mass transfer focusing on the precise simulation of crossover with diffusion, migration and convection. The influence of these phenomena on the capacity decay was systematically analyzed, revealing considerable impact of convection component, which dominates under diffusion and migration and mainly responsible for observed capacity loss. The model allows to simulate main characteristics of VRFB systems (such as battery voltage, state of charge, charge/discharge time and capacity decay due to crossover) with high accuracy. The model was validated with experimental data in the wide range of current densities (40–100 mA cm−2), and the results demonstrated good agreement with experiments having an average error within 5% range. In addition, the model requires a modest computational time and power, and, therefore, it can be suitable for application in advanced control-monitoring tools, which are necessary for a long-service life and sustainable operation of VRFB systems.},

abstract = {The vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) consists of the electrodes, pump, and membrane, but the pump is causative of self-discharge because it continuously operated the ions diffusion through membrane. Thus, the equivalent circuit of VRFB should consider the self-discharge to enhance the accuracy of the state of charge (SOC) estimation. This paper proposes the equivalent circuit model of VRFB, which is comprised of the basic RC ladder. In addition, to consider the self-discharge of VRFB the proposed equivalent circuit takes into account that the capacitance of the vanadium redox flow battery is changed by the charging and discharging cycles. The self-discharge test profile was proposed by applying the decreased capacity depending on cycles, and the derived amount of self-discharge was applied to the RC ladder based equivalent circuit model based on resistance. The parameters for the equivalent circuit model is extracted by the actual experimental data. The equivalent circuit model with the basic RC ladder is modeled by using MATLAB/Simulink. Based on the equivalent circuit model considering self-discharge, EKF (Extended Kalman filter) suitable for nonlinear system of vanadium redox flow battery was used for SOC estimation.},

abstract = {Thermal issue is one of the major concerns for safe, reliable, and efficient operation of the vanadium redox flow battery (VRB) energy storage systems. During the design of the operational strategy for a grid-connected VRB system, a suitable mathematical model is needed to predict the dynamic behaviors under various operating conditions. However, conventional VRB models usually neglect the impact of temperature variations on system performance. This work develops an enhanced VRB model with the consideration of the coupling effects between the electrochemical and the thermal behaviors. The proposed model consists of two equivalent circuits. First, the electrochemical behaviors of the VRB are modeled by a second-order RC network taking account of the effects of concentration variation of the vanadium ions and the electrochemical activation. Second, a third-order Cauer network is used to model the heat transfer process in the VRB system, and the dynamic thermal behaviors of stacks, pipes and heat exchangers are characterized. Well-designed experiments and particle swarm optimization algorithm are use to identify the parametric values of the developed model. The proposed modeling method was validated experimentally using a 5kW/3kWh VRB platform, and the results show that the model is capable of accurately predicting the VRB performance under variable temperature conditions. The developed coupled electro-thermal model is then used for simulating and analyzing the performance of a VRB system operated in conjunction with a wind power plant under real-world conditions.},

abstract = {Batteries are the crucial link in accelerating the penetration of renewables in distributed grid systems. With multiple sources (most of which are intermittent), there is a need to optimize the usage of these energy storage systems. It is vital to have a charging algorithm to intelligently charge the battery, considering the losses and state of health. Several battery charging techniques exist for most of the mainstream batteries such as lithium ion and lead acid batteries. These charging algorithms are developed for specific battery chemistries to optimize the charging operation by controlling the charging current. There has been no specific charging methodology proposed, considering the uniqueness of flow batteries. In this paper a flow battery model is developed to accommodate the implementation of charging protocols by controlling the current and flow rate in real time. The aim is to demonstrate a methodology where different user requirements can be programmed for efficient operation of the battery to perform a given task. The control is established by an intuitive fuzzy logic controller for changing the input variables based on the intrinsic losses, pump power loss and the capacity decay due to the aging of the battery. The need for such a controller to handle different scenarios of operation arises from the vast applicability of large scale energy storage. A simple example of such a system is proposed with demonstrating three operator selectable modes namely Autonomous (A), Energy bias (E) and Time bias (T). In each case, a specific current value and flow rate value is selected by the controller and is fine-tuned during the charging process. The values are tuned for specific modes of operation and different aspects of the battery performance are studied for these modes. This work demonstrates a method to leverage the use of a physical model based system in a high level user interface for controlling flow batteries.},

The variation of pump efficiency with flow rate is considered in the proposed system model, which makes the predicted system efficiency and coulomb efficiency more accurate.

In this new strategy, the coefficients of system model can be determined and adjusted according to the VRFB operating parameters, which can guarantee high system efficiency and coulomb efficiency simultaneously. In application of this new control strategy, the system efficiency and coulomb efficiency under variable flow rate strategy are always higher than that under constant flow rate, with 3.34% increasing for system efficiency and 3.84% increasing for coulomb efficiency by average.},

abstract = {An accurate battery model is the prerequisite for reliable state estimate of vanadium redox battery (VRB). As the battery model parameters are time varying with operating condition variation and battery aging, the common methods where model parameters are empirical or prescribed offline lacks accuracy and robustness. To address this issue, this paper proposes to use an online adaptive battery model to reproduce the VRB dynamics accurately. The model parameters are online identified with both the recursive least squares (RLS) and the extended Kalman filter (EKF). Performance comparison shows that the RLS is superior with respect to the modeling accuracy, convergence property, and computational complexity. Based on the online identified battery model, an adaptive peak power estimator which incorporates the constraints of voltage limit, SOC limit and design limit of current is proposed to fully exploit the potential of the VRB. Experiments are conducted on a lab-scale VRB system and the proposed peak power estimator is verified with a specifically designed “two-step verification” method. It is shown that different constraints dominate the allowable peak power at different stages of cycling. The influence of prediction time horizon selection on the peak power is also analyzed.},
