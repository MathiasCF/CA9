abstract = {Nonlinear dynamical systems are ubiquitous in science and engineering, yet analysis and prediction of these systems remains a challenge. Koopman operator theory circumvents some of these issues by considering the dynamics in the space of observable functions on the state, in which the dynamics are intrinsically linear and thus amenable to standard techniques from numerical analysis and linear algebra. However, practical issues remain with this approach, as the space of observables is infinite dimensional and selecting a subspace of functions in which to accurately represent the system is a nontrivial task. In this work we consider time-delay observables to represent nonlinear dynamics in the Koopman operator framework. We prove the surprising result that Koopman operators for different systems admit universal (system-independent) representations in these coordinates, and give analytic expressions for these representations. In addition, we show that for certain systems a restricted class of these observables form an optimal finite-dimensional basis for representing the Koopman operator, and that the analytic representation of the Koopman operator in these coordinates coincides with results computed by the dynamic mode decomposition. We provide numerical examples to complement our results. In addition to being theoretically interesting, these results have implications for a number of linearization algorithms for dynamical systems.},

abstract = {The use of data assimilation for the merging of observed data with dynamical models is becoming standard in modern physics. If a parametric model is known, methods such as Kalman filtering have been developed for this purpose. If no model is known, a hybrid Kalman-Takens method has been recently introduced, in order to exploit the advantages of optimal filtering in a nonparametric setting. This procedure replaces the parametric model with dynamics reconstructed from delay coordinates, while using the Kalman update formulation to assimilate new observations. In this article, we study the efficacy of this method for identifying underlying dynamics in the presence of dynamical noise. Furthermore, by combining the Kalman-Takens method with an adaptive filtering procedure we are able to estimate the statistics of the observational and dynamical noise. This solves a long-standing problem of separating dynamical and observational noise in time series data, which is especially challenging when no dynamical model is specified.},

@article{Carroll2018,
abstract = {Analyzing data from dynamical systems often begins with creating a reconstruction of the trajectory based on one or more variables, but not all variables are suitable for reconstructing the trajectory. The concept of nonlinear observability has been investigated as a way to determine if a dynamical system can be reconstructed from one signal or a combination of signals [L. A. Aguirre, IEEE Trans. Educ. 38, 33 (1995); C. Letellier, L. A. Aguirre, and J. Maquet, Phys. Rev. E 71, 066213 (2005); L. A. Aguirre, S. B. Bastos, M. A. Alves, and C. Letellier, Chaos 18, 013123 (2008); L. A. Aguirre and C. Letellier, Phys. Rev. E 83, 066209 (2011); and E. Bianco-Martinez, M. S. Baptista, and C. Letellier, Phys. Rev. E 91, 062912 (2015)]; however, nonlinear observability can be difficult to calculate for a high dimensional system. In this work, I compare the results from nonlinear observability to a continuity statistic that indicates the likelihood that there is a continuous function between two sets of multidimensional points - in this case, two different reconstructions of the same attractor from different signals are simultaneously measured. Without a metric against which to test the ability to reconstruct a system, the predictions of nonlinear observability and continuity are ambiguous. As an additional test on how well different signals can predict the ability to reconstruct a dynamical system, I use the fitting error from training a reservoir computer.},

abstract = {This work addresses fundamental issues related to the structure and conditioning of linear time-delayed models of non-linear dynamics on an attractor. While this approach has been well-studied in the asymptotic sense (e.g., for an infinite number of delays), the non-asymptotic setting is not well-understood. First, we show that the minimal time-delays required for perfect signal recovery are solely determined by the sparsity in the Fourier spectrum for scalar systems. For the vector case, we provide a rank test and a geometric interpretation for the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an accurate linear time delayed model. Furthermore, we prove that the output controllability index of a linear system induced by the Fourier spectrum serves as a tight upper bound on the minimal number of time delays required. An explicit expression for the exact linear model in the spectral domain is also provided. From a numerical perspective, the effect of the sampling rate and the number of time delays on numerical conditioning is examined. An upper bound on the condition number is derived, with the implication that conditioning can be improved with additional time delays and/or decreasing sampling rates. Moreover, it is explicitly shown that the underlying dynamics can be accurately recovered using only a partial period of the attractor. Our analysis is first validated in simple periodic and quasiperiodic systems, and sensitivity to noise is also investigated. Finally, issues and practical strategies of choosing time delays in large-scale chaotic systems are discussed and demonstrated on 3D turbulent Rayleigh-B{\'{e}}nard convection.},

abstract = {The present paper extends some results recently developed for the analysis of observability in nonlinear dynamical systems. The aim of the paper is to address the problem of embedding an attractor using more than one observable. A multivariate nonlinear observability matrix is proposed which includes the monovariable nonlinear and linear observability matrices as particular cases. Using the developed framework and a number of worked examples, it is shown that the choice of embedding coordinates is critical. Moreover, in some cases, to reconstruct the dynamics using more than one observable could be worse than to reconstruct using a scalar measurement. Finally, using the developed framework it is shown that increasing the embedding dimension, observability problems diminish and can even be eliminated. This seems to be a physically meaningful interpretation of the Takens embedding theorem. {\textcopyright} 2005 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Understanding the interplay of order and disorder in chaotic systems is a central challenge in modern quantitative science. We present a universal, data-driven decomposition of chaos as an intermittently forced linear system. This work combines Takens' delay embedding with modern Koopman operator theory and sparse regression to obtain linear representations of strongly nonlinear dynamics. The result is a decomposition of chaotic dynamics into a linear model in the leading delay coordinates with forcing by low energy delay coordinates; we call this the Hankel alternative view of Koopman (HAVOK) analysis. This analysis is applied to the canonical Lorenz system, as well as to real-world examples such as the Earth's magnetic field reversal, and data from electrocardiogram, electroencephalogram, and measles outbreaks. In each case, the forcing statistics are non-Gaussian, with long tails corresponding to rare events that trigger intermittent switching and bursting phenomena; this forcing is highly predictive, providing a clear signature that precedes these events. Moreover, the activity of the forcing signal demarcates large coherent regions of phase space where the dynamics are approximately linear from those that are strongly nonlinear.},

@article{Gonzalez2020,
abstract = {Observability can determine which recorded variables of a given system are optimal for discriminating its different states. Quantifying observability requires knowledge of the equations governing the dynamics. These equations are often unknown when experimental data are considered. Consequently, we propose an approach for numerically assessing observability using Delay Differential Analysis (DDA). Given a time series, DDA uses a delay differential equation for approximating the measured data. The lower the least squares error between the predicted and recorded data, the higher the observability. We thus rank the variables of several chaotic systems according to their corresponding least square error to assess observability. The performance of our approach is evaluated by comparison with the ranking provided by the symbolic observability coefficients as well as with two other data-based approaches using reservoir computing and singular value decomposition of the reconstructed space. We investigate the robustness of our approach against noise contamination.},

@article{Campbell2005,
abstract = {Agent-based modelling offers a way to break from the crude assumptions of mean-field type models, which ignore space correlations between elements of the system and replace local interactions with uniform long-range ones. Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) explicitly model spatially distributed individuals; however the richness of such a model can also be a liability due to the sensitive dependence of such high-dimensional systems. This has implications for choice of MAS architecture, programming of rules, confidence in predictions, and calibration of model parameters. Delay-embedding, also known as geometry from a time series, provides a deep theoretical foundation for the analysis of time series generated by nonlinear deterministic dynamical systems. The profound insight of embedding is that an accessible variable can explicitly retrieve unseen internal degrees of freedom. [3]. In the domain of complex systems modelling, however, there typically exist an abundance of observables, in which case reconstructing hidden degrees of freedom may be problematic or even nonsensical. Also, many observables often implies high dimensionality, which generally precludes a dynamical systems approach in the first instance. Uncautious use of delay-embedding, from which it is easy to get a result regardless of physical justification, has in the past led to a degree of negative press for this idea. However, the recent extensions of Takens' delay-embedding theorem to deterministically and stochastically forced systems [9, 8, 10] provide a rigorous framework in which to reconstruct using multiple observables. This holds great significance for pattern discovery in complex data series, which we define to be more than one series - spatial, temporal or a mixture - of an underlying complex system. In particular, the concept of a bundle embedding highlights a way to usefully employ the 'surplus' observables in the embedding process. More generally, forced embeddings provide a methodology to breakdown complex system data sets in a modular fashion, while still retaining nonlinear relationships. Cluster-Weighted Modelling is a sophisticated approach to density estimation that, when applied to the output of a delay-embedding process, is able to obtain a statistical representation of the dynamics. These two concepts - forced embeddings and density estimation - provide a promising theory and a practical probabilistic interpretation respectively to the 'inverse problem' of system identification. Expert-knowledge based MAS construction and density-estimation of delay-embedded data can therefore be thought of as two complementary approaches to the goal of bottom-up, complex systems modelling. The original contribution of this paper is to present the latter as a highly data-driven approach to MAS construction in its own right, and, perhaps more importantly, as an aid to constructing and calibrating the more expert-knowledge rule-driven approach. The emphasis is on a solid theoretical and conceptual foundation. To illustrate the feasibility of our approach, preliminary implementation results for an ecological modelling scenario are presented and discussed.},

@article{Stark1999,
abstract = {Takens Embedding Theorem forms the basis of virtually all approaches to the analysis of time series generated by nonlinear deterministic dynamical systems. It typically allows us to reconstruct an unknown dynamical system that gives rise to a given observed scalar time series simply by constructing a new state space out of successive values of the time series. This provides the theoretical foundation for many popular techniques, including those for the measurement of fractal dimensions and Liapunov exponents, for the prediction of future behaviour, for noise reduction and signal separation, and most recently for control and targeting. Current versions of Takens Theorem assume that the underlying system is autonomous. Unfortunately this is not the case for many real systems; in the laboratory we often force an experimental system in order for it to exhibit interesting behaviour, whilst in the case of naturally occurring systems it is very rare for us to be able to isolate the system to ensure that there are no external influences. In this paper we therefore prove two versions of Takens Theorem relevant to forced systems: one applicable to the case where the forcing is unknown, and the other to the situation where we are able to determine independently the state of the forcing system (usually because we are responsible for the forcing ourselves). In a subsequent paper we shall show how to extend these results to give an analogue of Takens Theorem for randomly forced systems, leading to a new framework for the analysis of time series arising from nonlinear stochastic systems.},

abstract = {Takens' theorem (1981) shows how lagged variables of a single time series can be used as proxy variables to reconstruct an attractor for an underlying dynamic process. State space reconstruction (SSR) from single time series has been a powerful approach for the analysis of the complex, non-linear systems that appear ubiquitous in the natural and human world. The main shortcoming of these methods is the phenomenological nature of attractor reconstructions. Moreover, applied studies show that these single time series reconstructions can often be improved ad hoc by including multiple dynamically coupled time series in the reconstructions, to provide a more mechanistic model. Here we provide three analytical proofs that add to the growing literature to generalize Takens' work and that demonstrate how multiple time series can be used in attractor reconstructions. These expanded results (Takens' theorem is a special case) apply to a wide variety of natural systems having parallel time series observations for variables believed to be related to the same dynamic manifold. The potential information leverage provided by multiple embeddings created from different combinations of variables (and their lags) can pave the way for new applied techniques to exploit the time-limited, but parallel observations of natural systems, such as coupled ecological systems, geophysical systems, and financial systems. This paper aims to justify and help open this potential growth area for SSR applications in the natural sciences. {\textcopyright} 2011 Deyle, Sugihara.},
